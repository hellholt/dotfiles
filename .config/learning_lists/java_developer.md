# Java Fundamentals

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.

Learn about the fundamentals of Java such as basic syntax, data types, variables, conditionals, functions, data structures, packages, etc.

# Basic Syntax

Understanding the basics is the key to a solid foundation. In this section, learn the basic terminologies, naming conventions, reserved words, conditions, functions, data structures, OOP, packages, etc.

- To print output use --> System.out.println();
- To take input from user --> Scanner or BufferedReader class can be used

# Data Types and Variables

Variable in Java is a data container that stores the data values during Java program execution. Every variable is assigned a data type, which designates the type and quantity of values it can hold. Variable is a memory location name of the data. The Java variables have mainly three types: Local, Instance and Static.

Data Types are divided into two group -
- Primitive - byte,short,int,long,float,double,boolean and char
- Non-Primitive - String, Arrays and Classes

- [Java Variables](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-variables)
- [Learn more about Data types and Variables](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types)

# Conditionals

Java has the following conditional statements:

- Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed if the same condition is false
- Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test; if the first condition is false
- Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
- Use `?,:` operator to specify one line condition

- [Conditionals and Loops in Java](https://youtu.be/ldYLYRNaucM)
- [Switch Statements + Nested Case in Java](https://youtu.be/mA23x39DjbI)

# Functions

A method/function is a way to perform some task. Similarly, in programming like Java, a function method is a block of code written to perform a specific task repeatedly. It provides reusability of code. We write the function once and use it many times. It works on the 'DRY' principle i.e., "Do not repeat yourself".

Steps -

1. Define function - datatype function_name(parameters){body}
2. Call function - function_name(values)

# Datastructures

As the name indicates itself, a **Data Structure** is a way of organizing the data in the **memory** so that it can be used efficiently. Some common data structures are array, linked list, stack, hashtable, queue, tree, heap, and graph.

- Array allocates continuous memory for homogeneous data
- Linked List stores data in nodes with references
- Stack follows Last In First Out principle
- Queue follows First In First Out principle

# Packages

A package is a namespace that mainly contains classes and interfaces. For instance, the standard class `ArrayList` is in the package `java.util`. For this class, `java.util.ArrayList` is called its fully qualified name because this syntax has no ambiguity. Classes in different packages can have the same name. For example, you have the two classes `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Date`, which are different. If no package is declared in a class, its package is the default package.

To create package use this command -> javac -d directory javafilename

- [Packages in Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Package.html)
- [Java Package](https://www.javatpoint.com/package)
- [Packages In Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packages-in-java/)

# Loops

In Java and other programming languages, loops are used to iterate a part of the program several times. There are four types of loops in Java, `for`, `forEach`, `while`, and `do...while`.

- Synatx of `for` loop is `for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement){}`
- Syntax of `forEach` loop is `for(data_type variable:array_name){}`

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [What are loops in Java?](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-for-loop)
- [Loops in Java.](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/for-loop)

# Exception Handling

Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved. Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

There are three types of exceptions -

1. Checked Exception - exceptions checked at compile time. Example - IOException
2. Unchecked Exception - exceptions checked at run time. Example - NullPointerException
3. Error - It is irrecoverable. Example - OutOfMemoryError

# Garbage Collection

Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management. Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run on a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM for short. When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap, which is a portion of memory dedicated to the program

# ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

A programming method to map objects in Java to relational entities in a database. In other words, converting data between relational databases and object-oriented programming languages. Some popular ORM tools/frameworks in Java are:

- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- Ebean

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ORM tutorial](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/object-relational-mapping/)
- [Java Databases: An Overview of Libraries & APIs](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/java-databases)

# JPA

The Jakarta Persistence API provides Java developers with an object/relational mapping facility for managing relational data in Java applications. JPA is not a tool nor a framework, but a set of interfaces for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and (a) relational database. Because it is a set of interfaces, it will require an implementation to work with and persist Java objects. This will be ORM. Here are the main features of JPA:

- Cleaner, easier, standardized ORM.
- Supports inheritance, polymorphism, and polymorphic queries.
- Supports metadata annotations/XML descriptors to define the mapping (between objects and relational database).
- Supports a rich, SQL-like query language for static and dynamic queries.
- Pluggable persistence providers like Hibernate, MyBatis, etc.
- Caching: JPA supports 2 kinds of cache - first and second levels - to support performance tuning.
- Read more [here](https://javabydeveloper.com/what-is-java-persistence-api/).

> Note: In 2019, JPA was renamed from Java Persistence API to Jakarta Persistence.

# Logging Frameworks

Logging is an important feature that helps developers to trace out the errors. It provides the ability to capture the log file. Logging provides the complete tracing information of the application and also records the critical failure if any occur in an application. There are three components of Logging: Logger, Logging handlers or Appenders and Layouts or logging formatters.

BDD is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test driven design, and is intended to make these practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike. It shifts the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based, and positions itself as a design philosophy.
