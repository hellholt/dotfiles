# Learn a Language

It doesn't matter what language you pick, but it is important to learn at least one. You will be able to use that language to write automation scripts.

# Python

Python is a multi-paradigm language. Being an interpreted language, code is executed as soon as it is written and the Python syntax allows for writing code in functional, procedural or object-oriented programmatic ways.  Python is frequently recommended as the first language new coders should learn, because of its focus on readability, consistency, and ease of use.  This comes with some downsides, as the language is not especially performant in most production tasks.

# Operating System

An Operating System is a program that manages a computer’s resources, especially the allocation of those resources among other programs. Typical resources include the central processing unit (CPU), computer memory, file storage, input/output (I/O) devices, and network connections.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [What is an operating system?](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/)
- [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8&ab_channel=CrashCourse)
- [Introduction to Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBURTt97EkA&list=PL9hkZBQk8d1zEGbY7ShWCZ2n1gtxqkRrS&index=1)

# Networking

Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.

Begin by studying the [OSI Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). This model will assist in constructing an understanding of the linked topics, and help you contextualize the items linked to the Networking, Security, and Protocols node. Higher level networking concepts may be implemented and named differently across cloud providers. Don't let this confuse you - the basics of TCP/IP are useful and used in the same ways across all implementations.

# Virtualization

Virtualization is the creation of a virtual -- rather than actual -- version of something, such as an operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network resources. It uses software that simulates hardware functionality to create a virtual system. This practice allows IT organizations to operate multiple operating systems, more than one virtual system and various applications on a single server.

# Memory Management

The term Memory can be defined as a collection of data in a specific format. It is used to store instructions and process data. The memory comprises a large array or group of words or bytes, each with its own location. The primary motive of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs, along with the information they access, should be in the main memory during execution. The CPU fetches instructions from memory according to the value of the program counter.

To achieve a degree of multiprogramming and proper utilization of memory, memory management is important. There are several memory management methods, reflecting various approaches, and the effectiveness of each algorithm depends on the situation.

- [Memory Management in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/)

# File System

A file is a named collection of related information recorded on secondary storage such as magnetic disks, magnetic tapes, and optical disks. Generally, a file is a sequence of bits, bytes, lines, or records whose meaning is defined by the file's creator and user.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Operating System - File System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_file_system.htm)

# Sockets

Socket is an endpoint of a two way **communication** link between **two different processes** on the network (same or different machines). The socket mechanism provides a means of inter-process communication (IPC) by establishing named contact points between client and server. It is the combination of IP Address and Port Number.

e.g. `http://192.168.0.1:8080`

# POSIX Basics

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a family of standards for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. It describes utilities, APIs, and services that a compliant OS should provide to software, thus making it easier to port programs from one system to another.

A practical example: in a Unix-like operating system, there are three *standard streams*, `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` - they are I/O connections that you will probably come across when using a terminal, as they manage the flow from the **standard input** (stdin), **standard output** (stdout) and **standard error** (stderr).

So, in this case, when we want to interact with any of these streams (through a process, for example), the POSIX operating system API makes it easier - for example, in the `<unistd.h>` C header where the stdin, stderr, and stdout are defined as `STDIN_FILENO`, `STDERR_FILENO` and `STDOUT_FILENO`.

POSIX also adds a standard for exit codes, filesystem semantics, and several other command line utility API conventions.

- [A guide to POSIX](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/posix)

# Processes

A process means program in execution. It generally takes an input, processes it and gives us the appropriate output. `ps` command can be used in linux to get the list of processes running in foreground. Each process will have a unique identifier called **PID**, which can be used to track it or `kill` it through shell.

**Types of processes:**

- Foreground processes
- Background processes

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Intro to Process Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-management/)
- [Process Management in Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/process-management-in-linux/)

- [Process vs Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread/)

# Startup Management (init.d)

`init.d` is a daemon which is the **first process** (PID = 1) of the Linux system. Then other processes, services, daemons, and threads are started by init. One can write their own scripts in *'/etc/init.d'* location to start services automatically on system boot. Services can be started and stopped manually by using `service` command.

It has following syntax: `$ service [service_name] [action]` e.g. `$ service ssh start`

- [What is init.d?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-init-d-in-linux-service-management/)
- [What are Daemons in Linux?](https://itsfoss.com/linux-daemons/)

# Service Management (systemd)

`systemd` is a **System** Management **D**aemon which replaces the sysvinit process to become the first process with PID = 1, which gets executed in user space during the Linux start-up process. It is a system that is designed specifically for the Linux kernel. It is now being used as a **replacement of init.d** to overcome shortcomings of it. It uses `systemctl` command to perform related operations.

e.g. `$ systemctl start [service-name]`, `$ systemctl poweroff`

- [Why Systemd as a replacement of init.d?](https://www.tecmint.com/systemd-replaces-init-in-linux/)

# Thread in OS

`Thread` is an active entity which executes a **part of a process**. It is a sequential flow of tasks within a process. It is also called lightweight process as they **share common resources**. A process can contain multiple threads. Threads are used to increase the performance of the applications.
Each thread has its own program counter, stack, and set of registers. But the threads of a single process might share the same code and data/file.

**Key Terminologies:**

- `proc`
- `fork`
- `join`

# Managing Servers

Server management includes all of the monitoring and maintenance required for servers to operate reliably and at optimal performance levels. Server management also involves the management of hardware, software, security, and backups all in service of keeping the IT environment operational and efficient. The primary goals of an effective server management strategy are to:

- Minimize server slowdowns and downtime while maximizing reliability.
- Build secure server environments.
- Scale servers and related operations to meet the needs of the organization over time.

# Networking Protocols

A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design. Network protocols are the reason you can easily communicate with people all over the world, and thus play a critical role in modern digital communications.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [What Is a Network Protocol, and How Does It Work?](https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-a-network-protocol)

# OSI Model

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a **conceptual** model consists of 7 layers, that was proposed to standardize the communication between devices over the network. It was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early 1980s.

- [FTP vs SFTP vs FTPS](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/file-transfer-protocol-ftp-meaning)

# SSL/TLS

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols used to provide security in internet communications. These protocols encrypt the data that is transmitted over the web, so anyone who tries to intercept packets will not be able to interpret the data. One difference that is important to know is that SSL is now deprecated due to security flaws, and most modern web browsers no longer support it. But TLS is still secure and widely supported, so preferably use TLS.

# SSH

The SSH (**S**ecure **Sh**ell) is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate over an insecure network. It is a secure alternative to the non-protected login protocols (such as telnet, rlogin) and insecure file transfer methods (such as FTP). It is mostly used for secure Remote Login and File Transfer.

`SFTP = FTP + SSH`

# Port Forwarding

Port forwarding, sometimes called **port mapping**, allows computers or services in private networks to connect over the internet with other public or private computers or services. Since firewalls exist to keep unwanted visitors out, the visitors you want to get in are going to need a way to do so. Knowing the IP address isn’t enough, Requests need to be directed to the correct port as well.

# Setting up x

# Reverse Proxy

A Reverse Proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. It provides an additional level of security by hiding the server related details like `IP Address` to clients. It is also known as **server side proxy**.

**Common Uses:**

- Load balancing
- Web acceleration
- Security and anonymity

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [What is Reverse Proxy?](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/)
- [NGINX documentation](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/)

# Caching server

A cache server is a **dedicated network server** or service acting as a server that saves Web pages or other Internet content locally. By placing previously requested information in temporary storage, or cache, a cache server both speeds up access to data and reduces demand on an enterprise's bandwidth.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Site Cache vs Browser Cache vs Server Cache](https://wp-rocket.me/blog/different-types-of-caching/)

# Forward Proxy

Forward Proxy, often called proxy server is a server that sits in front of a group of **client machines**. When those computers make requests to sites and services on the Internet, the proxy server intercepts those requests and then communicates with web servers on behalf of those clients, like a middleman.

**Common Uses:**

- To block access to certain content
- To protect client identity online
- To provide restricted internet to organizations

- [Forward vs Reverse Proxy](https://oxylabs.io/blog/reverse-proxy-vs-forward-proxy)

# Load Balancer

Load Balancer acts as the **traffic cop** sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked. If one of the servers goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers.

# Infrastructure as Code

Sometimes referred to as IaC, this section refers to the techniques and tools used to define infrastructure, typically in a markup language like YAML or JSON. Infrastructure as code allows DevOps Engineers to use the same workflows used by software developers to version, roll back, and otherwise manage changes.

The term Infrastructure as Code encompasses everything from bootstrapping to configuration to orchestration, and it is considered a best practice in the industry to manage all infrastructure as code.  This technique precipitated the explosion in system complexity seen in modern DevOps organizations.

# Containers

Containers are a construct in which [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups), [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces), and [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) are used to fully encapsulate and isolate a process.  This encapsulated process, called a container image, shares the kernel of the host with other containers, allowing containers to be significantly smaller and faster than virtual machines.

These images are designed for portability, allowing for full local testing of a static image, and easy deployment to a container management platform.

# Docker Swarm

A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are running the Docker application and that have been configured to join together in a cluster. Once a group of machines have been clustered together, you can still run the Docker commands that you're used to, but they will now be carried out by the machines in your cluster. The activities of the cluster are controlled by a swarm manager, and machines that have joined the cluster are referred to as nodes.

# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an [open source](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) container management platform, and the dominant product in this space.  Using Kubernetes, teams can deploy images across multiple underlying hosts, defining their desired availability, deployment logic, and scaling logic in YAML.  Kubernetes evolved from Borg, an internal Google platform used to provision and allocate compute resources.  (similar to the Autopilot and Aquaman systems of Microsoft Azure)

The popularity of Kubernetes has made it an increasingly important skill for the DevOps Engineer and has triggered the creation of Platform teams across the industry.  These Platform engineering teams often exist with the sole purpose of making Kubernetes approachable and usable for their product development colleagues.

# CI/CD

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams.

Specifically, CI/CD introduces ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the lifecycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment. Taken together, these connected practices are often referred to as a "CI/CD pipeline" and are supported by development and operations teams working together in an agile way with either a DevOps or site reliability engineering (SRE) approach.
