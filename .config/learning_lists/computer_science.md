# Pick a Language

You need to pick a programming language to learn the Computer Science concepts. My personal recommendation would be to pick C++ or C and the reason for that is:

* They allow you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures and algorithms in your bones. In higher level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day to day work, that's terrific, but when you're learning how these low-level data structures are built, it's great to feel close to the metal.
* You will be able to find a lot of resources for the topics listed in this roadmap using C or C++. You can find a lot of resources for Python and Java, but they are not as abundant as C++ and C.

Given below is the list of resources; pick ones relevant to the language of your choice.

* [Jagged Arrays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jtrQqYpt7g)

# Linked Lists

Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements stored and this allows faster access to an element at a specific index. Linked lists are less rigid in their storage structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations, hence they need to be stored with additional tags giving a reference to the next element. This difference in the data storage scheme decides which data structure would be more suitable for a given situation.

# Asymptotic Notation

The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm. The efficiency is measured with the help of asymptotic notations.

An algorithm may not have the same performance for different types of inputs. With the increase in the input size, the performance will change.

The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as asymptotic analysis.

# Character Encodings

Character encodings are a way of representing characters as numbers. They are used to store and transmit text. The most common character encoding is ASCII, which is a 7-bit encoding. This means that each character is represented by a number between 0 and 127. The ASCII character set contains 128 characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation, and control characters. The ASCII character set is a subset of the Unicode character set, which is a 16-bit encoding. Unicode is a superset of ASCII, so ASCII characters can be represented by Unicode. Unicode is the most common character encoding used on the web.

* [Character Encoding](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/charenc/)

# Unicode

Unicode is a standard for encoding characters. It is a superset of ASCII, which means that ASCII is a subset of Unicode. Unicode is a 16-bit encoding, which means that it can encode 2^16 = 65536 characters. This is a lot more than ASCII, which can only encode 128 characters.

# Usecase Diagrams

Usecase diagrams are a type of diagram that are used to model the interactions between the **actors** and the **usecases** of the system.

An actor is a person or a system that interacts with the system. Actors are represented by a rectangle with the name of the actor written inside it.

A usecase is a task that the system performs. Usecases are represented by an ellipse with the name of the usecase written inside it.

A usecase diagram is a diagram that shows the actors and the usecases of the system. The diagram is represented by a rectangle that contains the name of the system inside it. The actors are represented by rectangles and the usecases are represented by ellipses.

# Type Object Pattern

Type object pattern is a creational design pattern that allows us to create a new object of a type without exposing the object creation logic to the client. It is used when we need to create a new object of a type, but we don't know which type we need to create until runtime. It is like a factory pattern, but instead of returning a new object of a type, it returns a new object of a type that is already created.

# Combinatorics

Combinatorics is the study of counting. It is a branch of mathematics that is used to solve problems in a variety of fields, including computer science, statistics, and physics. In computer science, combinatorics is used to solve problems related to counting the number of possible outcomes of a given problem. For example, if you are given a set of 10 objects, how many different ways can you arrange them? Or, if you are given a set of 10 objects, how many different ways can you choose 3 objects from that set? These are examples of combinatorial problems.

# Complexity Classes

In computer science, there exist some problems whose solutions are not yet found, the problems are divided into classes known as Complexity Classes. In complexity theory, a Complexity Class is a set of problems with related complexity. These classes help scientists to groups problems based on how much time and space they require to solve problems and verify the solutions. It is the branch of the theory of computation that deals with the resources required to solve a problem.

# P = NP

The P = NP problem is one of the most famous problems in computer science. It asks if the problem of determining if a given input belongs to a certain class of problems is as hard as the problem of solving the given input. In other words, it asks if the problem of determining if a given input belongs to a certain class of problems is as hard as the problem of determining if a given input belongs to a certain class of problems. This problem is also known as the Halting Problem.

# Balanced Search Trees

Balanced search trees are a type of data structure that allow for fast insertion, deletion, and lookup of data. They are a type of self-balancing binary search tree, which means that they are a binary tree that maintains the binary search tree property while also keeping the tree balanced. This means that the tree is always approximately balanced, which allows for fast insertion, deletion, and lookup of data.

# AVL Trees

AVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. They are named after their inventors, Adelson-Velskii and Landis. AVL trees are the most popular self-balancing binary search tree.

In practice: From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be: The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter)

# Red/Black Trees

In computer science, a red–black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node stores an extra bit representing "color", used to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.

These are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below).

In practice: Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time. Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees; for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java, the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.

# 2-3 Search Trees

In practice: 2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).

You would use 2-3 tree very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red Black trees.

# 2-3-4 Search Trees

In practice: For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce 2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though 2-4 trees are not often used in practice.

# N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) Trees

Note: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches)

Binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2

2-3 trees are 3-ary

# B-Trees

Fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor).

In Practice: B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address

# Clustering

At a high level, a computer cluster is a group of two or more computers, or nodes, that run in parallel to achieve a common goal. This allows workloads consisting of a high number of individual, parallelizable tasks to be distributed among the nodes in the cluster. As a result, these tasks can leverage the combined memory and processing power of each computer to increase overall performance.

# Long Polling

Long polling is a technique used to implement server push functionality over HTTP. It is a method of opening a request on the server and keeping it open until an event occurs, at which point the server responds. This is in contrast to a regular HTTP request, where the server responds immediately with whatever data is available at the time.

* [What are Long-Polling, Websockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Comet?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11077857/what-are-long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events-sse-and-comet)

# Short Polling

In short polling, the client requests information from the server. The server processes the request. If data is available for the request, server responds to the request with the required information. However, if the server has no data available for the client, server returns an empty response. In both the situation, the connection will be closed after returning the response. Clients keep issuing new requests even after server sends the empty responses. This mechanism increases the network cost on the server.

# Web Sockets

Web sockets are a bidirectional communication protocol between a client and a server. They are used for real-time applications like chat, multiplayer games, and live data updates. Web sockets are also used to establish a connection between a server and a client. This connection is then used to send data in both directions.

# SQL vs NoSQL databases

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's used for relational databases. A SQL database is a collection of tables that stores a specific set of structured data. Some examples are PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB etc.

NoSQL stands for Not Only SQL. It's used for non-relational databases. A NoSQL database is a collection of collections that stores a specific set of unstructured data. Some examples are MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis etc.

# Normalization vs Denormalization

Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The idea is that a table should be about a specific topic and that only those columns which support that topic are included. This limits the number of duplicate data contained within your database. This makes the database more flexible by eliminating issues stemming from database modifications.

Denormalization is the opposite of normalization. It is the process of adding redundant data to a database to improve read performance. This is done by adding duplicate data into multiple tables to avoid expensive joins. This is done at the expense of increased storage and decreased write performance.

# DDL (Data Definition Language)

DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database. DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data. These commands are normally not used by a general user, who should be accessing the database via an application.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

* [SQL | DDL, DQL, DML, DCL and TCL Commands](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dql-dml-dcl-tcl-commands/)

# DML (Data Manipulation Language)

The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL statement that controls access to data and to the database. Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML statements.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

* [SQL | DDL, DQL, DML, DCL and TCL Commands](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dql-dml-dcl-tcl-commands/)

# DQL (Data Query Language)

DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it. We can define DQL as follows it is a component of SQL statement that allows getting data from the database and imposing order upon it. It includes the SELECT statement. This command allows getting the data out of the database to perform operations with it. When a SELECT is fired against a table or tables the result is compiled into a further temporary table, which is displayed or perhaps received by the program i.e. a front-end.

# BASE Model

The rise in popularity of NoSQL databases provided a flexible and fluidity with ease to manipulate data and as a result, a new database model was designed, reflecting these properties. The acronym BASE is slightly more confusing than ACID but however, the words behind it suggest ways in which the BASE model is different and acronym BASE stands for:-

* **B**asically **A**vailable
* **S**oft state
* **E**ventual consistency

The PACELC Theorem is an extension of the CAP Theorem. One of the questions that CAP Theorem wasn’t able to answer was “what happens when there is no Partition, What Logical Combination then a Distributed System have?“. So to answer this, In addition to Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance it also includes Latency as one of the desired properties of a Distributed System. The acronym PACELC stands for Partitioned, Availability, Consistency Else Latency, Consistency.

# Views

Views in SQL are kind of virtual tables. A view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database. We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database. A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain condition.

# Public Key Cryptography

Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys. Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key. Key pairs are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions.

# Hashing/Ecncryption/Encoding

Hashing is a one-way function that takes an input and produces a fixed-length output. The output is called a hash. The hash is a unique representation of the input. The hash is deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same hash. The hash is irreversible, meaning that it is impossible to go from the hash back to the original input. The hash is collision-resistant, meaning that it is impossible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash.

Encryption is a two-way function that takes an input and produces an output. The output is called ciphertext. The ciphertext is a unique representation of the input. The ciphertext is deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same ciphertext. The ciphertext is reversible, meaning that it is possible to go from the ciphertext back to the original input. The ciphertext is collision-resistant, meaning that it is impossible to find two different inputs that produce the same ciphertext.

Encoding is a two-way function that takes an input and produces an output. The output is called encoded text. The encoded text is a unique representation of the input. The encoded text is deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same encoded text. The encoded text is reversible, meaning that it is possible to go from the encoded text back to the original input. The encoded text is not collision-resistant, meaning that it is possible to find two different inputs that produce the same encoded text.

# Registers and RAMs

***Registers*** are the smallest data-holding elements built into the processor itself. Registers are the memory locations that are directly accessible by the processor. The registers hold the instruction or operands currently accessed by the CPU.

Registers are the high-speed accessible storage elements. The processor accesses the registers within one CPU clock cycle. The processor can decode the instructions and perform operations on the register contents at more than one operation per CPU clock cycle.

***Memory*** is a hardware device that stores computer programs, instructions, and data. The memory that is internal to the processor is primary memory (RAM), and the memory that is external to the processor is secondary (**Hard Drive**).
Primary memory or RAM is a volatile memory, meaning the primary memory data exist when the system's power is on, and the data vanishes as the system is switched off. The primary memory contains the data required by the currently executing program in the CPU. If the data required by the processor is not in primary memory, then the data is transferred from secondary storage to primary memory, and then it is fetched by the processor.

# Lock / Mutex / Semaphore

A lock allows only one thread to enter the part that's locked and the lock is not shared with any other processes.

A mutex is the same as a lock but it can be system wide (shared by multiple processes).

A semaphore does the same as a mutex but allows x number of threads to enter, this can be used for example to limit the number of cpu, io or ram intensive tasks running at the same time.

# Scheduling Algorithms

CPU Scheduling is the process of selecting a process from the ready queue and allocating the CPU to it. The selection of a process is based on a particular scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm is chosen depending on the type of system and the requirements of the processes.

Here is the list of some of the most commonly used scheduling algorithms:

* **First Come First Serve (FCFS):** The process that arrives first is allocated the CPU first. It is a non-preemptive algorithm.
* **Shortest Job First (SJF):** The process with the smallest execution time is allocated the CPU first. It is a non-preemptive algorithm.
* **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):** The process with the smallest remaining execution time is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.
* **Round Robin (RR):** The process is allocated the CPU for a fixed time slice. The time slice is usually 10 milliseconds. It is a preemptive algorithm.
* **Priority Scheduling:** The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.
* **Multi-level Queue Scheduling:** The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.
* **Multi-level Feedback Queue Scheduling:** The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. If a process is preempted, it is moved to the next queue. It is a preemptive algorithm.
* **Lottery Scheduling:** The process is allocated the CPU based on a lottery system. It is a preemptive algorithm.
* **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling:** The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. If a process is preempted, it is moved to the next queue. It is a preemptive algorithm.

# CPU Interrupts

CPU Interrupts are a way for the CPU to communicate with the rest of the computer. They are a way for the CPU to tell the rest of the computer that it needs to do something. For example, if the CPU is running a program and it needs to read from the keyboard, it will send an interrupt to the keyboard to tell it to send the data to the CPU. The CPU will then wait for the keyboard to send the data and then continue running the program.
