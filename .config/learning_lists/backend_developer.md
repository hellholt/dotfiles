- [Command line crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line)
- [Basic Terminal Usage - Cheat Sheet to make the command line EASY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDINUSK7rXE)

# Operating Systems

An operating system is a main program on computer, that governs all other applications. It allows you to use browsers, play games, print documents, launch your favorite program.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Operating System - Overview](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_overview.htm)
- [Operating System Concepts](https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS10/index.html)
- [Operating System Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GDX-IyZ_C8)

# Process Management

Process management involves various tasks like creation, scheduling, termination of processes, and a deadlock. Process is a program that is under execution, which is an important part of modern-day operating systems. The OS must allocate resources that enable processes to share and exchange information. It also protects the resources of each process from other methods and allows synchronization among processes.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Operating System: Process and Process Management](https://medium.com/@akhandmishra/operating-system-process-and-process-management-108d83e8ce60)
- [Process Management in OS: PCB in Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/process-management-pcb.html)

# Threads and Concurrency

A thread is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS. In most modern operating systems, a thread exists within a process - that is, a single process may contain multiple threads.

Concurrency refers to the execution of multiple threads at the same time. It occurs in an operating system when multiple process threads are executing concurrently. These threads can interact with one another via shared memory or message passing. Concurrency results in resource sharing, which causes issues like deadlocks and resource scarcity. It aids with techniques such as process coordination, memory allocation, and execution schedule to maximize throughput.

Working within the terminal is common practice for any Backend Developer and there are many commands and utilities that can help you achieve your tasks more efficiently.

The best way to learn these commands is to practice them in your own machine/environment. Specifically, these are related to Linux commands/utilities which are the most prevalent in the market.

To understand these commands, read through the manual pages by using `man` command e.g. `man grep`, `man awk` etc.

After enough exposure and practice to these commands, it will become easier to use these in practice

# Memory Management

The term Memory can be defined as a collection of data in a specific format. It is used to store instructions and process data. The memory comprises a large array or group of words or bytes, each with its own location. The primary motive of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs, along with the information they access, should be in the main memory during execution. The CPU fetches instructions from memory according to the value of the program counter.

To achieve a degree of multiprogramming and proper utilization of memory, memory management is important. There are several memory management methods, reflecting various approaches, and the effectiveness of each algorithm depends on the situation.

- [Interprocess Communication - Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJuYKfR8vec)

# I/O Management

One of the important jobs of an Operating System is to manage various I/O devices including mouse, keyboards, touchpad, disk drives, display adapters, USB devices, Bit-mapped screens, LED, Analog-to-digital converter, On/off switch, network connections, audio I/O, printers, etc.

# POSIX Basics

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a family of standards for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. It describes utilities, APIs, and services that a compliant OS should provide to software, thus making it easier to port programs from one system to another.

A practical example: in a Unix-like operating system, there are three *standard streams*, `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` - they are I/O connections that you will probably come across when using a terminal, as they manage the flow from the **standard input** (stdin), **standard output** (stdout) and **standard error** (stderr).

So, in this case, when we want to interact with any of these streams (through a process, for example), the POSIX operating system API makes it easier - for example, in the `<unistd.h>` C header where the stdin, stderr, and stdout are defined as `STDIN_FILENO`, `STDERR_FILENO` and `STDOUT_FILENO`.

POSIX also adds a standard for exit codes, filesystem semantics, and several other command line utility API conventions.

# Learn a Language

Even if you’re a beginner the least you would have known is that Web Development is majorly classified into two facets: Frontend Development and Backend Development. And obviously, they both have their respective set of tools and technologies. For instance, when we talk about Frontend Development, there always comes 3 names first and foremost – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

In the same way, when it comes to Backend Web Development – we primarily require a backend (or you can say server-side) programming language to make the website function along with various other tools & technologies such as databases, frameworks, web servers, etc.

Pick a language from the given list and make sure to learn its quirks, core details about its runtime e.g. concurrency, memory model etc.

# JavaScript

Apart from being used in the browser, JavaScript is also used in backend e.g. using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [Deno](https://deno.land/) for writing server-side code in JavaScript.

If you pick up JavaScript for the Backend, my personal recommendation would be to learn [JavaScript](/javascript) and then go with [Node.js](/nodejs) as it is the most popular and widely used option. Also, I would recommend learning TypeScript later on as you continue with your backend development Journey; it's a superset of JavaScript and is used in many projects.

# NoSQL databases

NoSQL databases offer data storage and retrieval that is modelled differently to "traditional" relational databases. NoSQL databases typically focus more on horizontal scaling, eventual consistency, speed and flexibility and is used commonly for big data and real-time streaming applications.
NoSQL is often described as a BASE system (**B**asically **A**vailable, **S**oft state, **E**ventual consistency) as opposed to SQL/relational which typically focus on ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Common NoSQL data structures include key-value pair, wide column, graph and document.

# Column Databases

A **<u>wide-column database</u>** (sometimes referred to as a column database) is similar to a relational database. It store data in tables, rows and columns. However in opposite to relational databases here each row can have its own format of the columns. Column databases can be seen as a two-dimensional key-value database. One of such database system is **Apache Cassandra**.

**Warning:** <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-column_store#Wide-column_stores_versus_columnar_databases">note that a "columnar database" and a "column database" are two different terms!</a>

# Timeseries databases

## InfluxDB

InfluxDB was built from the ground up to be a purpose-built time series database; i.e., it was not repurposed to be time series. Time was built-in from the beginning. InfluxDB is part of a comprehensive platform that supports the collection, storage, monitoring, visualization and alerting of time series data. It’s much more than just a time series database.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

# Realtime databases

A real-time database is broadly defined as a data store designed to collect, process, and/or enrich an incoming series of data points (i.e., a data stream) in real time, typically immediately after the data is created.

# Key-Value Databases

A key-value database (KV database) is a type of database that stores data as a collection of key-value pairs. In a KV database, each piece of data is identified by a unique key, and the value is the data associated with that key.

KV databases are designed for fast and efficient storage and retrieval of data, and they are often used in applications that require high performance and low latency. They are particularly well-suited for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as log data and user profiles.

Some popular KV databases include Redis, Memcached, and LevelDB. These databases are often used in combination with other types of databases, such as relational databases or document databases, to provide a complete and scalable data storage solution.

- [ACID Explained: Atomic, Consistent, Isolated & Durable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaQ5YMWkxq4)

# Transactions

In short, a database transaction is a sequence of multiple operations performed on a database, and all served as a single logical unit of work — taking place wholly or not at all. In other words, there's never a case where only half of the operations are performed and the results saved.

# Database Normalization

Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model.

Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design).

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)
- [Basic Concept of Database Normalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoTyrdT9SZI)# Failure Modes

There are several different failure modes that can occur in a database, including:

- Read contention: This occurs when multiple clients or processes are trying to read data from the same location in the database at the same time, which can lead to delays or errors.
- Write contention: This occurs when multiple clients or processes are trying to write data to the same location in the database at the same time, which can lead to delays or errors.
- Thundering herd: This occurs when a large number of clients or processes try to access the same resource simultaneously, which can lead to resource exhaustion and reduced performance.
- Cascade: This occurs when a failure in one part of the database system causes a chain reaction that leads to failures in other parts of the system.
- Deadlock: This occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release a lock on a resource, leading to a standstill.
- Corruption: This occurs when data in the database becomes corrupted, which can lead to errors or unexpected results when reading or writing to the database.
- Hardware failure: This occurs when hardware components, such as disk drives or memory, fail, which can lead to data loss or corruption.
- Software failure: This occurs when software components, such as the database management system or application, fail, which can lead to errors or unexpected results.
- Network failure: This occurs when the network connection between the database and the client is lost, which can lead to errors or timeouts when trying to access the database.
- Denial of service (DoS) attack: This occurs when a malicious actor attempts to overwhelm the database with requests, leading to resource exhaustion and reduced performance.

# Profiling Performance

There are several ways to profile the performance of a database:

- Monitor system performance: You can use tools like the Windows Task Manager or the Unix/Linux top command to monitor the performance of your database server. These tools allow you to see the overall CPU, memory, and disk usage of the system, which can help identify any resource bottlenecks.
- Use database-specific tools: Most database management systems (DBMSs) have their own tools for monitoring performance. For example, Microsoft SQL Server has the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and the sys.dm_os_wait_stats dynamic management view, while Oracle has the Oracle Enterprise Manager and the v$waitstat view. These tools allow you to see specific performance metrics, such as the amount of time spent waiting on locks or the number of physical reads and writes.
- Use third-party tools: There are also several third-party tools that can help you profile the performance of a database. Some examples include SolarWinds Database Performance Analyzer, Quest Software Foglight, and Redgate SQL Monitor. These tools often provide more in-depth performance analysis and can help you identify specific issues or bottlenecks.
- Analyze slow queries: If you have specific queries that are running slowly, you can use tools like EXPLAIN PLAN or SHOW PLAN in MySQL or SQL Server to see the execution plan for the query and identify any potential issues. You can also use tools like the MySQL slow query log or the SQL Server Profiler to capture slow queries and analyze them further.
- Monitor application performance: If you are experiencing performance issues with a specific application that is using the database, you can use tools like Application Insights or New Relic to monitor the performance of the application and identify any issues that may be related to the database.

Have a look at the documentation for the database that you are using.

# gRPC

gRPC is a high-performance, open source universal RPC framework

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call, there's an ongoing debate on what the g stands for. RPC is a protocol that allows a program to execute a procedure of another program located on another computer. The great advantage is that the developer doesn’t need to code the details of the remote interaction. The remote procedure is called like any other function. But the client and the server can be coded in different languages.

- [Oktane17: Designing Beautiful REST + JSON APIs (3:56 - 5:57)](https://youtu.be/MiOSzpfP1Ww?t=236)

# Open api spec

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language and runtime system for APIs (application programming interfaces). It is designed to provide a flexible and efficient way for clients to request data from servers, and it is often used as an alternative to REST (representational state transfer) APIs.

One of the main features of GraphQL is its ability to specify exactly the data that is needed, rather than receiving a fixed set of data from an endpoint. This allows clients to request only the data that they need, and it reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.

GraphQL also provides a way to define the structure of the data that is returned from the server, allowing clients to request data in a predictable and flexible way. This makes it easier to build and maintain client applications that depend on data from the server.

GraphQL is widely used in modern web and mobile applications, and it is supported by a large and active developer community.

# Sharding strategies

Sharding strategy is a technique to split a large dataset into smaller chunks (logical shard) in which we distribute these chunks in different machines/database nodes in order to distribute the traffic load. It’s a good mechanism to improve the scalability of an application. Many databases support sharding, but not all.

# Caching

Caching is a technique of storing frequently used data or information in a local memory, for a certain time period. So, next time, when the client requests the same information, instead of retrieving the information from the database, it will give the information from the local memory. The main advantage of caching is that it improves the performance by reducing the processing burden.

# CDN (Content Delivery Network)

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) service aims to provide high availability and performance improvements of websites. This is achieved with fast delivery of website assets and content typically via geographically closer endpoints to the client requests.
Traditional commercial CDNs (Amazon CloudFront, Akamai, CloudFlare and Fastly) provide servers across the globe which can be used for this purpose.
Serving assets and contents via a CDN reduces bandwidth on website hosting, provides an extra layer of caching to reduce potential outages and can improve website security as well

# Client Side Caching

Client-side caching is the storage of network data to a local cache for future re-use. After an application fetches network data, it stores that resource in a local cache. Once a resource has been cached, the browser uses the cache on future requests for that resource to boost performance.

# SHA family

SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms) is a family of cryptographic hash functions created by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The family includes:

- SHA-0: Published in 1993, this is the first algorithm in the family. Shortly after its release, it was discontinued for an undisclosed significant flaw.
- SHA-1: Created to replace SHA-0 and which resembles MD5, this algorithm has been considered insecure since 2010.
- SHA-2: This isn't an algorithm, but a set of them, with SHA-256 and SHA-512 being the most popular. SHA-2 is still secure and widely used.
- SHA-3: Born in a competition, this is the newest member of the family. SHA-3 is very secure and doesn't carry the same design flaws as its brethren.

# HTTPS

HTTPS is a secure way to send data between a web server and a browser.

A communication through HTTPS starts with the handshake phase during which the server and the client agree on how to encrypt the communication, in particular they choose an encryption algorithm and a secret key. After the handshake all the communication between the server and the client will be encrypted using the agreed upon algorithm and key.

The handshake phase uses a particular kind of cryptography, called asymmetric cryptography, to communicate securely even though client and server have not yet agreed on a secret key. After the handshake phase the HTTPS communication is encrypted with symmetric cryptography, which is much more efficient but requires client and server to both have knowledge of the secret key.

# Server Security

Learn about the security of your server and how to secure it. Here are some of the topics off the top of my head:

- Use a firewall: One of the most effective ways to secure a server is to use a firewall to block all unnecessary incoming traffic. You can use iptables on Linux systems or a hardware firewall to do this.
- Close unnecessary ports: Make sure to close any ports that are not needed for your server to function properly. This will reduce the attack surface of your server and make it more difficult for attackers to gain access.
- Use strong passwords: Use long, complex passwords for all of your accounts, and consider using a password manager to store them securely.
- Keep your system up to date: Make sure to keep your operating system and software up to date with the latest security patches. This will help to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited by attackers.
- Use SSL/TLS for communication: Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt communication between your server and client devices. This will help to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and other types of cyber threats.
- Use a intrusion detection system (IDS): An IDS monitors network traffic and alerts you to any suspicious activity, which can help you to identify and respond to potential threats in a timely manner.
- Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of authentication, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.

Also learn about OpenSSL and creating your own PKI as well as managing certs, renewals, and mutual client auth with x509 certs

# SSL/TLS

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols used to provide security in internet communications. These protocols encrypt the data that is transmitted over the web, so anyone who tries to intercept packets will not be able to interpret the data. One difference that is important to know is that SSL is now deprecated due to security flaws, and most modern web browsers no longer support it. But TLS is still secure and widely supported, so preferably use TLS.

# Testing

A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the code.

- [What is Software Testing?](https://www.guru99.com/software-testing-introduction-importance.html)
- [Testing Pyramid](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/testing-pyramid-for-test-automation)

# Integration Testing

Integration testing is a broad category of tests where multiple software modules are **integrated** and tested as a group. It is meant to test the **interaction** between multiple services, resources, or modules. For example, an API's interaction with a backend service, or a service with a database.

- [What is Integration Testing?](https://youtu.be/QYCaaNz8emY)

# Unit Testing

Unit testing is where individual **units** (modules, functions/methods, routines, etc.) of software are tested to ensure their correctness. This low-level testing ensures smaller components are functionally sound while taking the burden off of higher-level tests. Generally, a developer writes these tests during the development process and they are run as automated tests.

- [What is Unit Testing?](https://youtu.be/3kzHmaeozDI)

# Functional Testing

Functional testing is where software is tested to ensure functional requirements are met. Usually, it is a form of black box testing in which the tester has no understanding of the source code; testing is performed by providing input and comparing expected/actual output.
It contrasts with non-functional testing, which includes performance, load, scalability, and penetration testing.

# Design and development principles# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They can be broken into three categories:

- Creational Patterns for the creation of objects
- Structural Patterns to provide relationship between objects
- Behavioral Patterns to help define how objects interact

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Design Patterns for Humans](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans)
- [GOF design patterns](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/)
- [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

# Domain-Driven Design

Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.

In terms of object-oriented programming, it means that the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.

DDD connects the implementation to an evolving model and it is predicated on the following goals:

- Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;
- Basing complex designs on a model of the domain;
- Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.

- [Domain Driven Design Quickly](https://matfrs2.github.io/RS2/predavanja/literatura/Avram%20A,%20Marinescu%20F.%20-%20Domain%20Driven%20Design%20Quickly.pdf)

# Test Driven Development

Test driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests for software's requirements which will fail until the software is developed to meet those requirements. Once those tests pass, then the cycle repeats to refactor code or develop another feature/requirement. In theory, this ensures that software is written to meet requirements in the simplest form, and avoids code defects.

# CQRS

CQRS, or command query responsibility segregation, defines an architectural pattern where the main focus is to separate the approach of reading and writing operations for a data store. CQRS can also be used along with Event Sourcing pattern in order to persist application state as an ordered of sequence events, making it possible to restore data to any point in time.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [CQRS Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)

# Event Sourcing

Event sourcing is a design pattern in which the state of a system is represented as a sequence of events that have occurred over time. In an event-sourced system, changes to the state of the system are recorded as events and stored in an event store. The current state of the system is derived by replaying the events from the event store.

One of the main benefits of event sourcing is that it provides a clear and auditable history of all the changes that have occurred in the system. This can be useful for debugging and for tracking the evolution of the system over time.

Event sourcing is often used in conjunction with other patterns, such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and domain-driven design, to build scalable and responsive systems with complex business logic. It is also useful for building systems that need to support undo/redo functionality or that need to integrate with external systems.

- [Monolithic Architecture - Advantages & Disadvantages](https://datamify.medium.com/monolithic-architecture-advantages-and-disadvantages-e71a603eec89)

# Microservices

Microservice architecture is a pattern in which highly cohesive, loosely coupled services are separately developed, maintained, and deployed. Each component handles an individual function, and when combined, the application handles an overall business function.

# SOA

SOA, or service-oriented architecture, defines a way to make software components reusable via service interfaces. These interfaces utilize common communication standards in such a way that they can be rapidly incorporated into new applications without having to perform deep integration each time.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Reference Architecture Foundation for Service Oriented Architecture](http://docs.oasis-open.org/soa-rm/soa-ra/v1.0/soa-ra.html)

# Serverless

Serverless is an architecture in which a developer builds and runs applications without provisioning or managing servers. With cloud computing/serverless, servers exist but are managed by the cloud provider. Resources are used as they are needed, on demand and often using auto scaling.

# Service Mesh

A service mesh is a network of microservices that are connected using a mesh of interconnected, intelligent proxies. It is used to manage and secure communication between microservices, and it provides features such as load balancing, service discovery, and observability.

In a service mesh, each microservice is typically represented by an instance of a lightweight, transparent proxy called an "envoy." The envoys handle the communication between microservices and provide features such as load balancing, routing, and security.

Service meshes are typically implemented using a sidecar pattern, in which the envoys are deployed alongside the microservices they are responsible for. This allows the service mesh to be decoupled from the microservices and makes it easier to manage and update.

Service meshes are commonly used in cloud-native architectures and are often managed using a control plane, which is responsible for configuring and managing the envoys. Some popular service mesh implementations include Istio and Linkerd.

The Twelve-Factor App is a methodology for building scalable and maintainable software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. It is based on a set of best practices that were identified by the authors of the methodology as being essential for building modern, cloud-native applications.

The Twelve-Factor App methodology consists of the following principles:

- Codebase: There should be a single codebase for the application, with multiple deployments.
- Dependencies: The application should explicitly declare and isolate its dependencies.
- Config: The application should store configuration in the environment.
- Backing services: The application should treat backing services as attached resources.
- Build, release, run: The application should be built, released, and run as an isolated unit.
- Processes: The application should be executed as one or more stateless processes.
- Port binding: The application should expose its services through port binding.
- Concurrency: The application should scale out by adding more processes, not by adding threads.
- Disposability: The application should be designed to start and stop quickly.
- Dev/prod parity: The development, staging, and production environments should be as similar as possible.
- Logs: The application should treat logs as event streams.
- Admin processes: The application should run admin/maintenance tasks as one-off processes.

The Twelve-Factor App methodology is widely adopted by developers of SaaS applications, and it is seen as a best practice for building cloud-native applications that are scalable, maintainable, and easy to deploy.

# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an [open source](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) container management platform, and the dominant product in this space.  Using Kubernetes, teams can deploy images across multiple underlying hosts, defining their desired availability, deployment logic, and scaling logic in YAML.  Kubernetes evolved from Borg, an internal Google platform used to provision and allocate compute resources.  (similar to the Autopilot and Aquaman systems of Microsoft Azure)

The popularity of Kubernetes has made it an increasingly important skill for the DevOps Engineer and has triggered the creation of Platform teams across the industry.  These Platform engineering teams often exist with the sole purpose of making Kubernetes approachable and usable for their product development colleagues.

# Web Servers

Web servers can be either hardware or software, or perhaps a combination of the two.

### Hardware Side

A hardware web server is a computer that houses web server software and the files that make up a website (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web server establishes a connection to the Internet and facilitates the physical data exchange with other web-connected devices.

### Software side

A software web server has a number of software components that regulate how hosted files are accessed by online users. This is at the very least an HTTP server. Software that knows and understands HTTP and URLs (web addresses) is known as an HTTP server (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). The content of these hosted websites is sent to the end user's device through an HTTP server, which may be accessed via the domain names of the websites it holds.

Basically, an HTTP request is made by a browser anytime it wants a file that is stored on a web server. The relevant (hardware) web server receives the request, which is then accepted by the appropriate (software) HTTP server, which then locates the requested content and returns it to the browser over HTTP. (If the server cannot locate the requested page, it responds with a 404 error.)

# Building for Scale

Speaking in general terms, scalability is the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to it.  

A software that was conceived with a scalable architecture in mind, is a system that will support higher workloads without any fundamental changes to it, but don't be fooled, this isn't magic. You'll only get so far with smart thinking without adding more sources to it.  

For a system to be scalable, there are certain things you must pay attention to, like:
- Coupling
- Observability
- Evolvability
- Infrastructure

When you think about the infrastructure of a scalable system, you have two main ways of building it: using on-premises resources or leveraging all the tools a cloud provider can give you.  

The main difference between on-premises and cloud resources will be FLEXIBILITY, on cloud providers you don't really need to plan ahead, you can upgrade your infrastructure with a couple of clicks, while with on-premises resources you will need a certain level of planning.

# Instrumentation, Monitoring, and Telemetry

Instrumentation refers to the measure of a product's performance, in order to diagnose errors and to write trace information. Instrumentation can be of two types: source instrumentation and binary instrumentation.

Backend monitoring allows the user to view the performance of infrastructure i.e. the components that run a web application. These include the HTTP server, middleware, database, third-party API services, and more.

Telemetry is the process of continuously collecting data from different components of the application. This data helps engineering teams to troubleshoot issues across services and identify the root causes. In other words, telemetry data powers observability for your distributed applications.

- [What is Telemetry?](https://www.sumologic.com/insight/what-is-telemetry/)

# Migration Strategies

Learn how to run database migrations effectively. Especially zero downtime multi-phase schema migrations. Rather than make all changes at once, do smaller incremental changes to allow old code, and new code to worth with the database at the same time, before removing old code, and finally removing the parts of the database schema which is no longer used.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Databases as a Challenge for Continuous Delivery](https://phauer.com/2015/databases-challenge-continuous-delivery/)

# Horizontal/Vertical Scaling

Horizontal scaling is a change in the **number** of a resource. For example, increasing the number of virtual machines processing messages in a queue. Vertical scaling is a change in the **size/power** of a resource. For example, increasing the memory or disk space available to a machine. Scaling can be applied to databases, cloud resources, and other areas of computing.

# Observability

In sofware development, observability is the measure of how well we can understand a system from the work it does, and how to make it better.

So what makes a system to be "observable"? It is its ability of producing and collecting metrics, logs and traces in order for us to understand what happens under the hood and identify issues and bottlenecks faster.

You can of course implement all those features by yourself, but there are a lot of softwares out there that can help you with it like Datadog, Sentry and CloudWatch.
