# Kubernetes overview

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

# Running Applications

For running application in a Kubernetes cluster, you need to define Kubernetes objects such as Deployment or StatefulSet, Service, and ConfigMap or Secret using YAML files. The Deployment or StatefulSet defines the container image, container ports, and other settings. The Service provides a stable IP address and DNS name to access the application, while the ConfigMap or Secret contains configuration data or sensitive information. To deploy the application, use kubectl apply to create or update the Kubernetes objects. Kubernetes automatically manages the deployment, scaling, and networking of the application based on the YAML files. Monitoring and modification can be done through kubectl commands.

- [Kubernetes Tutorial | Run & Deploy Spring Boot Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o7e8OAAWyg)

# Pods

In Kubernetes, a pod is the smallest deployable unit that represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster. A pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and can access the same storage volumes. Pods are created and managed by Kubernetes, and they are scheduled to run on one of the nodes in the cluster. Pods provide a lightweight and flexible abstraction layer that enables Kubernetes to manage the deployment, scaling, and networking of containerized applications. Pods also facilitate the communication and data exchange between containers running in the same pod.

- [Pods Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)
- [What is a Pod in kubernetes ? Why do you need it ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0fzMZgpp14)

# ReplicaSets

A ReplicaSet is a controller that ensures a specified number of replicas (identical copies) of a pod are running in a cluster at all times. ReplicaSets help to ensure high availability and scalability by automatically scaling the number of pod replicas up or down in response to changes in demand or hardware failures. They are defined by a YAML file that specifies the desired number of replicas, the pod template to use, and other settings. They are responsible for monitoring the status of pods and creating or deleting replicas as necessary to meet the desired state.

- [ReplicaSet Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)
- [ReplicaSet in Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WM-LsH6tKc)

# Deployments

# StatefulSets

It is a controller that manages the deployment and scaling of a set of stateful pods that require stable network identities and stable storage volumes. StatefulSets are used to run stateful applications such as databases, where the order and uniqueness of each pod is important. StatefulSets provide unique stable network identities and stable storage volumes for each pod, which allows stateful applications to maintain data consistency even when they are scaled up or down, or when nodes fail or are replaced. StatefulSets are defined by a YAML file that includes a pod template, a service to access the pods, and other settings.

Learn more from the following links:

- [StatefulSets Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
- [Kubernetes StatefulSet | Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPQKAR1pA9U)

# Jobs

a Job is a controller that manages the execution of a finite task or batch job. Jobs are used to run short-lived tasks, such as batch processing, data analysis, or backups, that run to completion and then terminate. Jobs create one or more pods to run the task, and they monitor the completion status of each pod. If a pod fails or terminates, the Job automatically creates a replacement pod to ensure that the task is completed successfully. Jobs are defined by a YAML file that includes a pod template, completion criteria, and other settings.

# Services and Networking

Services and networking are key components that enable communication between pods and external clients. Services provide a stable endpoint for accessing a set of pods, while networking plugins and configuration options enable pod-to-pod communication and network isolation. These features are designed to be scalable, reliable, and flexible, making it easier for developers to manage and orchestrate complex microservices architectures. Additional features like Ingress and DNS-based service discovery provide flexible external access to services and simplify service discovery within a cluster.

Learn more from the following resources:

- [Service - Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
- [The Kubernetes Network Model](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/#the-kubernetes-network-model)

# Networking and Pod to Pod Communication

Networking is crucial for communication between pods and resources in a Kubernetes cluster. Each pod has a unique IP address and can communicate with other pods directly. Container networking interface (CNI) plugins are used to configure pod network interfaces and provide isolation between pods. Kubernetes also provides networking services such as load balancing, service discovery, and ingress, which enable external traffic to access pods and services. These services are implemented using Kubernetes objects such as Services, Ingress, and NetworkPolicies. Networking and pod-to-pod communication are essential for scalability, reliability, and flexibility in Kubernetes clusters.

- [Job with Pod-to-Pod Communication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/job-with-pod-to-pod-communication

# Load Balancing

Load balancing in distributes network traffic across multiple pods or nodes using a Service object. A Service provides a stable network endpoint for a set of pods, allowing other pods or external clients to access them through a single IP address and DNS name. Kubernetes offers three types of load balancing algorithms for Services, which distribute traffic based on round-robin, least connections, or IP hash. Load balancing is an essential part of Kubernetes networking, providing efficient and reliable traffic distribution across a cluster.

# Setting Resource Requests and Limits

Resource requests and limits in Kubernetes specify the minimum and maximum amount of CPU and memory a container requires to run. Resource requests are used for scheduling containers on nodes with sufficient resources, while limits enforce resource quotas and prevent containers from consuming too much. These settings can be configured at the pod or container level using the resources field in YAML. It's important to set resource requests and limits correctly to ensure optimal resource utilization in your Kubernetes cluster.

Learn more from the following resources:

- [Requests and limits - Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits)
- [Motivation for default memory limits and requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/memory-default-namespace/#motivation-for-default-memory-limits-and-requests)

# Assigning Quotas to Namespaces

Assigning quotas to namespaces is a way to limit resource usage for specific groups of resources in Kubernetes. Quotas can be set for CPU, memory, and other resources, as well as for the number of objects in a namespace. This can help ensure fair resource distribution across different teams or projects within a cluster. Quotas can be applied to individual namespaces or across the entire cluster. Kubernetes allows for both hard quotas, which enforce strict resource limits, and soft quotas, which allow for overages up to a certain point. Quotas can be managed using the Kubernetes API or through YAML configuration files.

# Monitoring and Optimizing Resource Usage

Monitoring and optimizing resource usage in Kubernetes (k8s) is crucial for ensuring efficient and effective use of resources. To monitor resource usage, k8s provides a Metrics Server, and Prometheus can be integrated with k8s. The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) can also be used to monitor container-level resource usage data. To optimize resource usage, setting appropriate requests and limits, using Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), implementing pod affinity and anti-affinity rules, and controlling node selection can all help reduce resource contention and improve resource utilization. By monitoring and optimizing resource usage, k8s can ensure that applications run efficiently and resources are used effectively.

# Role Based Acccess Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of controlling access to Kubernetes resources based on the roles assigned to users or groups. RBAC involves creating roles and binding them to users or groups to control access to Kubernetes resources. Roles are defined as a set of rules that determine what actions can be performed on specific resources. By assigning roles to users or groups, access to Kubernetes resources can be restricted or granted based on the permissions defined in the role. RBAC helps ensure the security and integrity of Kubernetes clusters by limiting access to authorized users and groups.

# Autoscaling

Autoscaling in Kubernetes involves adjusting the resources allocated to a deployment or set of pods based on demand. It includes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA), which increase or decrease replicas or adjust resource requests and limits, respectively. Autoscaling can be used with Cluster Autoscaling to efficiently allocate resources and ensure application responsiveness. It's useful for handling variable workloads or sudden spikes in traffic.

Learn more from the following resources:

- [Autoscaling in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/07/autoscaling-in-kubernetes/)
- [Kubernetes cluster autoscaling for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM36M39MA3I)

# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

It is a feature in Kubernetes that automatically scales the number of replicas of a pod based on the current demand for the workload it is running. The HPA controller monitors the CPU utilization or other metrics of the pod and adjusts the number of replicas of the pod to meet the specified target. This helps to ensure that the workload can handle increases in traffic and demand without overloading the resources of the cluster.

Learn more from the following resources:

- [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling - Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)
- [Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling - Kubernetes Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm3jnETOoFo)

# Vertical Pod Autoscaler

Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) is a Kubernetes feature that automates the process of adjusting resource limits for containers in pods. Unlike Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), which scales the number of replicas of a pod, VPA scales the resources allocated to a pod's containers. It adjusts the resource requests and limits for each container based on its actual usage.

- [What is Kubernetes VPA?](https://www.kubecost.com/kubernetes-autoscaling/kubernetes-vpa/)
- [Vertical Pod Autoscaling: Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h-vDDTZrm8)

# Cluster Autoscaling

Cluster Autoscaling is a feature in Kubernetes that automatically scales the cluster based on node resource utilization. It monitors the utilization of nodes and creates or removes nodes accordingly to ensure the appropriate amount of resources are available to handle the workload while minimizing costs. There are different approaches to implementing Cluster Autoscaling, such as using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler or Cluster Autoscaler. It's useful in scenarios with highly variable workloads, ensuring applications remain responsive and available without manual adjustments to the cluster size.

# Scheduling

Scheduling in Kubernetes refers to the process of assigning workloads to specific nodes in a cluster. The Kubernetes scheduler makes scheduling decisions based on factors such as resource availability, node suitability, and workload priorities. It balances workloads across the cluster to ensure efficient resource utilization and avoid overloading nodes. Scheduling takes into account factors such as geographic location, hardware requirements, and application-specific needs.

Learn more from the following links:

- [Kubernetes Scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/)
- [Scheduling Framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/)

# Scheduling Basics

Scheduling involves assigning pods to worker nodes based on criteria such as resource availability, labels, affinity/anti-affinity rules, taints, and tolerations. Pods are the smallest deployable units in k8s, consisting of one or more containers that share the same network namespace. The scheduler is responsible for assigning pods to nodes, while labels are used for matching. Affinity and anti-affinity rules dictate how pods are scheduled based on their relationships with other pods or nodes. QoS is used to prioritize pod scheduling based on their resource requirements.

- [Kubernetes Scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/)
- [How Scheduling in Kubernetes Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FvQR-0tK54)

# Taints and Tolerations

Taints and tolerations are used in Kubernetes to restrict or allow pods to be scheduled on certain nodes based on labels. A taint is a label that is applied to a node to indicate certain limitations or requirements. A toleration is a label applied to a pod to indicate that it can tolerate certain taints. When a node has a taint, only pods with the corresponding tolerations can be scheduled on that node. This feature is useful for various purposes, such as ensuring separation of critical and non-critical workloads, reserving nodes for certain tasks, and protecting nodes from overloading.

# Topology Spread Constraints

Topology spread constraints ensure even distribution of pods across a cluster's topology. Constraints define rules for the number of pods of a certain type that can run on a given level, such as nodes, zones, or racks. These constraints can be customized to fit specific needs, such as ensuring that critical workloads are spread across multiple zones. They help prevent single points of failure and improve application resilience by preventing resource overloading and promoting balanced distribution of workloads. Constraints can be added using the Kubernetes API or command line interface.

# Pod Priorities

Pod priorities in Kubernetes determine the order in which pods are scheduled on nodes when there are competing demands for resources. Each pod is assigned a numeric priority value, with higher values indicating higher priority. The scheduler maximizes the total priority of scheduled pods while also considering node suitability, taints and tolerations, and affinity and anti-affinity rules. Priorities can be set manually or automatically based on business logic or application requirements. Priorities help ensure that critical workloads receive necessary resources and are scheduled first, while lower priority workloads are scheduled when resources become available.

- [Kubernetes Pod Priority (Examples)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR_Zmvme3-0)

# Evictions

Evictions terminate or delete running pods from a node due to reasons like resource constraints or pod failures. They can be initiated by the system or administrators manually through the API. Evictions can be graceful, allowing pods to clean up resources, or forceful, immediately terminating them. Kubernetes provides preemption and pod disruption budgets to handle evictions effectively and minimize service disruptions. Evictions are necessary to manage and maintain Kubernetes clusters, and Kubernetes provides tools to handle them.

# Storage and Volumes

Volumes provide directories accessible to containers running in a pod and can be backed by various storage types. Persistent volumes are independent of pods and can be reused by multiple pods, while persistent volume claims request specific amounts of storage from persistent volumes. Storage classes allow administrators to define different storage types that can be dynamically provisioned.

# CSI drivers

CSI (Container Storage Interface) drivers in Kubernetes provide a standard way for storage providers to integrate with Kubernetes and offer persistent storage for containerized applications. They operate as separate containerized processes and communicate with Kubernetes through a well-defined API. CSI drivers allow Kubernetes to access a wide range of storage systems and provide advanced features like snapshotting and cloning.

- [CSI in Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brXPQ1Qwjl4)

# Stateful Applications

In Kubernetes, storage is a key component for stateful applications, as these applications require persistent data storage that is available across multiple replicas of the application. Kubernetes provides several options for storage, including volumes, persistent volumes, and storage classes.

Volumes are the basic building blocks of storage in Kubernetes. A volume is a directory that is accessible to the container running the application, and it can be backed by different types of storage, such as a host directory, a cloud provider disk, or a network storage system. Volumes are created and managed by Kubernetes, and they can be mounted into containers as part of a pod definition.

# Deployment Patterns

Deployments is a Kubernetes resource used to declaratively manage the rollout and scaling of application containers across a cluster. Deployments allow teams to define the desired state of a deployment and automatically manage the underlying pods and replica sets to achieve that state. Kubernetes provides various deployment strategies such as RollingUpdate or Canary to control how new versions of an application are rolled out and scaled.

# CI CD Integration

Integrating CI/CD with Kubernetes involves setting up a pipeline to build and deploy your application to a Kubernetes cluster. This process typically includes developing your application code, setting up a source code repository, choosing a CI/CD tool, building a Docker image, pushing the image to a container registry, deploying the application using Kubernetes manifests, and monitoring and troubleshooting the pipeline and deployment as needed. By automating the testing and deployment of your applications, CI/CD with Kubernetes can help improve software quality, speed up development, and ensure consistent and reliable deployments.

# GitOps

GitOps is a set of practices for managing infrastructure and applications using Git repositories as the source of truth for declarative configuration. In Kubernetes, GitOps involves using Git as the single source of truth for both the desired and actual state of the system, automating deployment and management tasks, and often using it in conjunction with Continuous Delivery (CD) practices. The result is a more consistent, reliable, and automated approach to managing infrastructure and applications.

# Helm Charts

Helm is a Kubernetes package manager that simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications through the use of reusable and versioned Helm charts. These charts are composed of YAML files that describe related sets of Kubernetes resources and can be customized using values files and templating with Go templates. Helm charts can also have dependencies on other charts and be stored in a centralized repository like Helm Hub for easy sharing and access. By utilizing Helm, teams can streamline application management and reduce duplication of effort.

# Canary Deployments

Canary Deployments is a technique used in Kubernetes to gradually roll out new versions of an application by directing a small percentage of users or traffic to the new version while the majority continue using the old version. This approach allows for testing the new version under real-world conditions before fully committing to the update. In Kubernetes, canary deployments can be implemented using tools such as Istio, Linkerd, or Nginx, or by using built-in features like deployment strategies and traffic routing.

# Blue Green Deployments

It is a deployment strategy used in Kubernetes for deploying new versions of an application by running two identical production environments, one with the current version (blue) and the other with the new version (green). After the green environment is fully tested, traffic is routed from the blue environment to the green environment, providing a seamless transition for users and avoiding any downtime or disruption. In Kubernetes, Blue-Green Deployments can be implemented using a variety of tools and techniques, including deployment strategies, traffic routing, and load balancing.

# Rolling Updates Rollbacks

Rolling Updates is a deployment strategy in Kubernetes for deploying new versions of an application by gradually updating existing pods with the new version while ensuring that the application remains available throughout the process. Kubernetes allows teams to configure Rolling Updates to update a certain percentage of pods at a time and wait for them to become available before proceeding with the update. In case of any issues, Kubernetes provides a Rollback mechanism, allowing teams to easily revert to the previous version of the application.

# Custom Controllers

Custom controllers in Kubernetes automate the management of custom resources that are not natively supported by Kubernetes. They are implemented as Kubernetes controllers that watch custom resources and react to changes in their state. Custom resources are created by extending the Kubernetes API with new resource types specific to an organization's needs. Custom controllers can be developed using various programming languages and frameworks, such as the Operator Framework. The Operator Framework provides tools and best practices for developing, testing, and deploying custom controllers.

# Custom Schedulers Extenders

Custom Scheduler Extenders in Kubernetes enhance the scheduling capabilities of Kubernetes by allowing users to define their own scheduling logic based on custom metrics and constraints. They are implemented as custom Kubernetes controllers that run alongside the Kubernetes scheduler. Custom Scheduler Extenders can be used to implement scheduling policies specific to an organization's needs and can be developed using various programming languages. They intercept scheduling requests, add custom scheduling logic based on user-defined rules, and pass requests back to the Kubernetes scheduler.

# Custom Resource Definitions

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in Kubernetes extend the Kubernetes API by defining new resource types specific to an organization's needs. CRDs create custom resources that can manage a wide variety of resources, such as applications, databases, storage, and networking. They are defined using YAML or JSON manifests and can be created and managed using the Kubernetes API server. Once created, custom resources can be managed using Kubernetes controllers and integrated with other Kubernetes components. CRDs are a powerful tool for streamlining operations in Kubernetes and enabling organizations to manage resources in a more efficient and customized way.

- [KUBERNETES | Install Kubernetes Cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro2qeYeisZQ)

# Control Plane Installation

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new pod when a deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied). Control plane components can be run on any machine in the cluster. However, for simplicity, set up scripts typically start all control plane components on the same machine, and do not run user containers on this machine.
