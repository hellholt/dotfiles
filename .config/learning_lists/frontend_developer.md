# What is HTTP?

HTTP is the `TCP/IP` based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. HTTP follows a classical "Client-Server model" with a client opening a connection request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, that means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

# Version Control Systems

Version control systems allow you to track changes to your codebase/files over time. They allow you to go back to some previous version of the codebase without any issues. Also, they help in collaborating with people working on the same code – if you’ve ever collaborated with other people on a project, you might already know the frustration of copying and merging the changes from someone else into your codebase; version control systems allow you to get rid of this issue.

# Web Storage API

The Web Storage API provides mechanisms for storing key-value pairs in a web browser. It includes two storage objects: localStorage and sessionStorage, which allow you to save data on the client side and persist it across multiple browser sessions, respectively.

The Web Storage API is designed to be simple and easy to use, and it is widely supported across modern web browsers. It is often used as an alternative to cookies, as it allows for larger amounts of data to be stored and is more efficient in terms of performance.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Web Storage API - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)

# Web Sockets

Web Sockets is a technology that allows for full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between a client and a server, and is typically used in applications that require high-speed, low-latency communication, such as online gaming and real-time data streaming.

Web Sockets utilizes a persistent connection between a client and a server, allowing for continuous data exchange without the need for the client to send additional requests to the server. This makes it more efficient and faster than other technologies, such as HTTP, which require a new request to be sent for each piece of data.

Web Sockets is supported by most modern web browsers and can be used with a variety of programming languages and frameworks.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Web Sockets - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)

# Server Sent Events

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a technology that allows a web server to push data to a client in real-time. It uses an HTTP connection to send a stream of data from the server to the client, and the client can listen for these events and take action when they are received.

SSE is useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat systems, stock tickers, and social media feeds. It is a simple and efficient way to establish a long-lived connection between a client and a server, and it is supported by most modern web browsers.

To use SSE, the client must create an EventSource object and specify the URL of the server-side script that will send the events. The server can then send events by writing them to the response stream with the proper formatting.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Server-Sent Events - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)

# Service Workers

Service Workers are a type of web worker that acts as a proxy between a web page and the network, allowing web developers to build offline-first and reliable applications. Service Workers can intercept network requests, access the cache, and make decisions on how to respond to a request based on the available resources.

Service Workers are written in JavaScript and are registered by a web page. Once registered, they can control the page and all its requests, even when the page is not open in a browser. This allows Service Workers to enable features such as push notifications, background synchronization, and offline support.

Service Workers are supported by most modern web browsers, and they are an essential component of progressive web applications (PWAs).

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Service Workers - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)

# Location API

The Geolocation API is a web API that provides access to the device's location data, such as latitude and longitude. It allows web developers to build location-based applications, such as mapping and location sharing, by using the device's GPS, Wi-Fi, and other sensors to determine the user's location.

To use the Geolocation API, a web page must first request permission from the user to access their location. If permission is granted, the page can then use the `navigator.geolocation` object to access the device's location data. The API provides several methods for getting the user's current location, watching for location changes, and calculating distances between two locations.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Geolocation API - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)

# Notifications API

The Notifications API is a web API that allows web pages to display system-level notifications to the user. These notifications can be used to alert the user of important events, such as new messages or updates, even when the web page is not open in the browser.

To use the Notifications API, a web page must first request permission from the user to display notifications. If permission is granted, the page can then use the `Notification` constructor to create a new notification and display it to the user. The notification can include a title, body text, and an icon, and it can be customized with options such as a timeout and a click action.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Notifications API - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API)

# Device Orientation API

The Device Orientation API is a web API that provides access to the device's orientation and motion data, such as its pitch, roll, and yaw. It allows web developers to build applications that can respond to the device's orientation and motion, such as augmented reality and motion-controlled games.

To use the Device Orientation API, a web page must first request permission from the user to access the device's orientation data. If permission is granted, the page can then use the DeviceOrientationEvent object to access the device's orientation data and respond to changes in orientation. The API provides several properties for accessing the device's orientation and motion data, as well as events for detecting changes in orientation.

The Device Orientation API is supported by most modern web browsers and is often used in conjunction with other APIs, such as the Geolocation API, to build location-based applications.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Device Orientation API - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Device_orientation_events)

# Payments

The Payment Request API is a web API that allows web developers to build checkout flows within their web applications. It provides a standardized, browser-based interface for collecting payment and shipping information from the user, and it supports a wide range of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets.

To use the Payment Request API, a web page must first create a `PaymentRequest` object and specify the payment and shipping options that are available to the user. The page can then invoke the Payment Request UI by calling the `show()` method on the `PaymentRequest` object. The user can then select their preferred payment and shipping options and confirm the payment, at which point the Payment Request API will return a payment response object that can be used to complete the transaction.

The Payment Request API is supported by most modern web browsers and is designed to be simple and efficient for both the developer and the user.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Payment Request API - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API)

# Credentials API

The Credential Management API is a web API that allows web developers to integrate password-based and federated login flows into their applications. It provides a standardized, browser-based interface for storing and retrieving user credentials, such as username and password combinations and OAuth tokens.

To use the Credential Management API, a web page must first create a Credential object and specify the credentials that the user wishes to store. The page can then use the navigator.credentials object to store and retrieve the user's credentials. The API provides several methods for storing and retrieving credentials, as well as for prompting the user to sign in or sign up.

# PRPL Pattern

The PRPL pattern is a performance optimization pattern for web applications that focuses on minimizing the time it takes for the initial rendering of a web page. It stands for Push, Render, Pre-cache, and Lazy-load, and it involves the following steps:

- Push: Prioritize the delivery of critical resources, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to the client as early as possible.
- Render: Start rendering the web page as soon as the critical resources are received, even if some non-critical resources are still being downloaded.
- Pre-cache: Pre-cache non-critical resources in the background so that they are available when needed.
- Lazy-load: Defer the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed, such as when the user scrolls to them or interacts with them.

The PRPL pattern is designed to improve the perceived performance of a web page by reducing the time it takes for the page to become interactive. It is particularly useful for applications that are served over slow or unreliable networks, as it allows the page to render as quickly as possible and then gradually load the remaining resources.

# RAIL Model

The RAIL model is a performance optimization model for web applications that focuses on improving the perceived performance of a web page. It stands for Response, Animation, Idle, and Load, and it involves the following four performance goals:

- Response: The time it takes for the web page to respond to user input should be under 100 milliseconds.
- Animation: The time it takes for an animation to run should be under 10 milliseconds.
- Idle: The web page should take advantage of idle time to perform non-critical tasks.
- Load: The time it takes for the web page to fully load should be under 1 second.

The RAIL model is designed to provide a framework for optimizing the performance of a web page by focusing on the four key areas that impact the user's perception of performance. It is particularly useful for applications that require high levels of interactivity, such as games and social media applications.

# Performance Metrics

Web performance metrics are quantitative measures of the performance of a web page or application. They are used to assess the speed and efficiency of a web page, and they can help identify areas for improvement. Some common web performance metrics include:

- Load time: The time it takes for a web page to fully load and become interactive.
- First contentful paint (FCP): The time it takes for the first content to appear on the page.
- Time to interactive (TTI): The time it takes for the page to become fully interactive.
- First input delay (FID): The time it takes for the page to respond to the first user input.
- Total blocking time (TBT): The time it takes for the page to become fully interactive, taking into account the time spent blocking the main thread.

There are many tools and techniques available for measuring web performance metrics, including browser dev tools, performance monitoring tools, and web performance APIs. By tracking these metrics and analyzing the results, web developers can identify areas for improvement and optimize the performance of their web pages.

# Browser DevTools

Most of the browsers have built-in developer tools that help you perform web development specific tasks on a webpage. My personal recommendation would be to use Chrome DevTools as it is the most advanced and has the most features. However, if you are using a different browser, you can still use the DevTools to debug your web application.

Chrome DevTools is a set of web development tools built into the Google Chrome browser. It allows web developers to debug and optimize web pages by providing a range of features for inspecting and manipulating the page's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Some of the features provided by Chrome DevTools include:

- **Elements panel**: Inspect and modify the page's HTML and CSS.
- **Console panel**: View and debug JavaScript errors and log messages.
- **Network panel**: Monitor network requests and responses, and analyze performance issues.
- **Performance panel**: Analyze the performance of the page and identify bottlenecks.
- **Application panel**: Inspect the page's resources, such as cookies and local storage.

Chrome DevTools is a powerful and essential tool for web developers, and it is widely used to debug and optimize web pages. It is constantly updated with new features and improvements, and it is available on all modern web browsers.

# Flutter

Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).

Flutter consists of two important parts:

- An SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android).
- A Framework (UI Library based on widgets): A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs.
To develop with Flutter, you will use a programming language called Dart. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years.

Dart focuses on front-end development, and you can use it to create mobile and web applications.

If you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dart's syntax to JavaScript.
