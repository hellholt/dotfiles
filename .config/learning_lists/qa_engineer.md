# QA Basics

The phrase "fit for use or purpose" sums up quality, which is incredibly difficult to define. It all comes down to fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the consumer in terms of the product's usefulness, design, dependability, durability, and price.

Assurance is nothing more than a confident statement made about a good or service. It is the assurance that a good outcome is guaranteed for a good or service. It offers a warranty that the product will perform faultlessly in accordance with expectations or needs.

Quality Assurance (QA) also known as QA testing is an activity to ensure that an organization provides the best product or service to the customers. QA testing of a software involves the testing of performance, adaptability, and functionality. Yet, software quality assurance extends beyond software quality; it also comprises the quality process used for developing, testing, and release of software products. QA relies on the software development cycle, which includes the management of software requirements, design, coding, testing, and release.

# What is Quality

Quality is extremely hard to define, and it is simply stated: “Fit for use or purpose.” It is all about meeting the needs and expectations of customers concerning the functionality, design, reliability, durability, & price of the product.

## What is Assurance

Assurance is nothing but a positive declaration of a product or service, which gives confidence. It is certain of a product or a service which it will work well. It provides a guarantee that the product will work without any problems as per the expectations or requirements.

## Quality Assurance in Software Testing

Quality Assurance in Software Testing is defined as a procedure to ensure the quality of software products or services provided to the customers by an organization. Quality assurance focuses on improving the [software development process](https://www.guru99.com/software-development-life-cycle-tutorial.html) and making it efficient and effective per the quality standards defined for software products. Quality Assurance is popularly known as QA Testing.

# Tester Mindset

As a Quality Assurance Engineer, your job is to look for the weak spots in a product, whatever that product may be, and report them back, so that they can be fixed and thus, the product you are working on can be of the highest quality possible.

To do your job successfully, you need to have a Testing mindset. What does that mean? Among other things, it means you have to think in the most destructive way possible and be as creative as possible.

A few important points:

- Know the product you are testing
- Don’t be afraid to think outside of the box when you are testing it
- Don’t be afraid to misuse it as much as possible.

# Test Oracles

A test oracle is a mechanism; different from the program itself that can be used to check the correctness of the program's output for the test cases. Conceptually, we can consider testing a process in which the test cases are given to the test oracle and the program under testing.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [What are Test Oracles](https://ecomputernotes.com/software-engineering/what-are-test-oracles)

# Test Prioritization

Test prioritization is ordering the test cases to be conducted eventually. Prioritizing test cases aids to meet two important constraints, namely time and budget in software testing to enhance the fault detection rate as early as possible.

# QA Manual Testing

Manual Testing is a type of software testing in which test cases are executed manually by a tester without using any automated tools. The purpose of Manual Testing is to identify the bugs, issues, and defects in the software application. Manual software testing is the most primitive technique of all testing types and it helps to find critical bugs in the software application.

# Test Cases and Scenarios

A Test Case is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application. A Test Case contains test steps, test data, precondition, and postcondition developed for a specific test scenario to verify any requirement. The test case includes specific variables or conditions, using which a testing engineer can compare expected and actual results to determine whether a software product is functioning as per the requirements of the customer.

A Test Scenario is defined as any functionality that can be tested. It is a collective set of test cases which helps the testing team to determine the positive and negative characteristics of the project.

The main goal of verification process is to ensure quality of software application, design, architecture etc. The verification process involves activities like reviews, walk-throughs and inspection.

Validation in Software Engineering is a dynamic mechanism of testing and validating if the software product actually meets the exact needs of the customer or not. The process helps to ensure that the software fulfills the desired use in an appropriate environment. The validation process involves activities like unit testing, integration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing.

# Automated Testing

Automation Testing is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite. On the contrary, Manual Testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer carefully executing the test steps.

Automated testing is the application of software tools to automate a human-driven manual process of reviewing and validating a software product. Most modern agile and DevOps software projects now include automated testing from inception. To fully appreciate the value of automated testing, however, it helps to understand what life was like before it was widely adopted.

# Non Functional Testing

In the process of Software testing, testing and analyzing only software’s functions doesn't complete the testing process. There are some other attributes which will demonstrate the entire software quality, they are known as quality characteristics. These characteristics include performance, security, usability, and reliability. Also not testing and analyzing the report of these characteristics will not affect the function of software, it will work to a degree of extent, but testing of these quality characteristics are referred to as QA non-functional testing.

# QA reporting

The International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) glossary defines a QA report as: *Documentation summarizing test activities and results*.
By documenting the testing that was conducted and the results that were achieved, QA reports provide valuable insight into the health of the code base and critical metrics. As such, they should be generated on a regular basis to ensure the quality standards are being met.
So basically, test reports should document all of the test cases that were performed during software testing, as well as the results of those tests. They should also deliver relevant information about the product and highlight any areas where improvements can be made.

# JUnit

JUnit is known as a unit testing framework used for the Java programming language. JUnit has been playing a crucial in the development of test-driven development and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks. JUnit is useful to write repeatable tests for your application code units. JUnit stimulates the idea of “testing first, then coding,”. The test approach explicates –test a little + code a little = JUnit. JUnit helps the programmer by increasing the productivity and the stability of the program’s code snippets.That will helps in reducing the time of the tester, which is spent on debugging of the code.

# CI / CD

Continuous Integration is a software development method where team members integrate their work at least once daily. An automated build checks every integration to detect errors in this method. In Continuous Integration, the software is built and tested immediately after a code commit. In a large project with many developers, commits are made many times during the day. With each commit, code is built and tested.

Continuous Delivery is a software engineering method in which a team develops software products in a short cycle. It ensures that software can be easily released at any time. The main aim of continuous delivery is to build, test, and release software with good speed and frequency. It helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for frequent updates in production.

# Headless Testing

Headless testing is when end-to-end tests are performed without loading the browser's user interface. Since the browser operates as a typical browser would but does not make use of the user interface, it is considered highly suitable for automated testing.

A few example cases where one may use headless browser testing include:

- Automating HTML event responses, such as form submission, keyboard events, mouse-clicking, etc.
- Web scraping
- Generating screenshots of webpages

Visit the following resources to learn more:

# HtmlUnit

HtmlUnit is a "GUI-Less browser for Java programs". It models HTML documents and provides an API that allows you to invoke pages, fill out forms, click links, etc... just like you do in your "normal" browser. It has fairly good JavaScript support (which is constantly improving) and is able to work even with quite complex AJAX libraries, simulating Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer depending on the configuration used.

HtmlUnit is not a generic unit testing framework. It is specifically a way to simulate a browser for testing purposes and is intended to be used within another testing framework such as JUnit or TestNG.
