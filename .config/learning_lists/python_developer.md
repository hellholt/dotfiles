## Variables

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.

# Functions

In programming, a function is a reusable block of code that executes a certain functionality when it is called. Functions are integral parts of every programming language because they help make your code more modular and reusable.

In Python, you define a function with the `def` keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon.

# Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries

**Lists:** are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python.

**Tuple:** A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists that are mutable.

**Set:** A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. Python’s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.

**Dictionary:** In python, Dictionary is an ordered (since Py 3.7) [unordered (Py 3.6 & prior)] collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.

# String Methods

Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square bracket can be used to access elements of the string.
There are methods which can be used on a string to best utilize it's wide range of functionalities.
Below Given resources can be utilised to learn more about them.

# Data Structures and Algorithms

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.

# Arrays and Linked lists

Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements stored and this allows faster access to an element at a specific index. Linked lists are less rigid in their storage structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations, hence they need to be stored with additional tags giving a reference to the next element. This difference in the data storage scheme decides which data structure would be more suitable for a given situation.

# Heaps Stacks and Queues

**Stacks:** Operations are performed LIFO (last in, first out), which means that the last element added will be the first one removed. A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list. If the stack runs out of memory, it’s called a stack overflow.

**Queue:** Operations are performed FIFO (first in, first out), which means that the first element added will be the first one removed. A queue can be implemented using an array.

**Heap:** A tree-based data structure in which the value of a parent node is ordered in a certain way with respect to the value of its child node(s). A heap can be either a min heap (the value of a parent node is less than or equal to the value of its children) or a max heap (the value of a parent node is greater than or equal to the value of its children).

# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order.

The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, if data is stored in a sorted manner.

# Advanced Topics

Now that you have covered the basics of Python, let's move on to some advanced topics. In this section, you will be learning about things like OOP, Lambdas, Decorators, Iterators, Modules, and more.

# Regular Expressions

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Regular Expressions in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- [ ] [Python Regular Expressions](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions)
- [ ] [Python - Regular Expressions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_reg_expressions.htm)

# Decorators

decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Python Decorators](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/decorators-python)
- [ ] [Decorators in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decorators-in-python/)
- [ ] [Decorators in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUUSfJO_J4)

# Lambdas

Python Lambda Functions are anonymous function means that the function is without a name. As we already know that the def keyword is used to define a normal function in Python. Similarly, the lambda keyword is used to define an anonymous function in Python.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Python Lambda Functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-lambda-anonymous-functions-filter-map-reduce/)
- [ ] [Lambdas in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp)

# Iterators

An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values. An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values. Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods **iter**() and **next**() .

- [ ] [Iterators in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_iterators.asp)
- [ ] [Python Iterators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterators-in-python/)

# List Comprehensions

List comprehensions are a concise way to create a list using a single line of code in Python. They are a powerful tool for creating and manipulating lists, and they can be used to simplify and shorten code.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [ ] [Python - List Comprehension](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp)
- [ ] [Python List Comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)

# Generator Compressions

Generator comprehensions are a concise way to create a generator using a single line of code in Python. They are similar to list comprehensions, but instead of creating a list, they create a generator object that produces the values on-demand, as they are needed.

Generator comprehensions are a useful tool for creating generators that generate a large sequence of values, as they allow you to create the generator without creating the entire sequence in memory at once. This can be more efficient and use less memory, especially for large sequences.

# Python Paradigms

Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means that it supports several programming paradigms. Some of the main paradigms supported by Python are:

- Imperative programming: This paradigm focuses on telling the computer what to do, step by step. Python supports imperative programming with features such as variables, loops, and control structures.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP): This paradigm is based on the idea of objects and their interactions. Python supports OOP with features such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Functional programming: This paradigm is based on the idea of functions as first-class citizens, and it emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data. Python supports functional programming with features such as higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and generators.
- Aspect-oriented programming: This paradigm is based on the idea of separating cross-cutting concerns from the main functionality of a program. Python does not have built-in support for aspect-oriented programming, but it can be achieved using libraries or language extensions.

Python's support for multiple paradigms makes it a versatile and flexible language, and it allows developers to choose the paradigm that best fits their needs.

# Version Control Systems

Version control systems allow you to track changes to your codebase/files over time. They allow you to go back to some previous version of the codebase without any issues. Also, they help in collaborating with people working on the same code – if you’ve ever collaborated with other people on a project, you might already know the frustration of copying and merging the changes from someone else into your codebase; version control systems allow you to get rid of this issue.

# Package Managers

Package managers allow you to manage the dependencies (external code written by you or someone else) that your project needs to work correctly.

`PyPI` and `Pip` are the most common contenders but here are some other options available as well:

- [ ] [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/) : Manages dependencies via isolation
- [ ] [**PIPX**](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) : Isolation-based app deployment, so you don't have to affect the system or user PIP libraries. It enables you to try individual python CLI tools without affecting other dependencies.

# PyPI

PyPI, typically pronounced pie-pee-eye, is a repository containing several hundred thousand packages. These range from trivial Hello, World implementations to advanced deep learning libraries.

- [ ] [How to Publish an Open-Source Python Package to PyPI](https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/)

# Pip

The standard package manager for Python is pip. It allows you to install and manage packages that aren’t part of the Python standard library.

- [ ] [Python PIP Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp)

# Conda

Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language.

Conda as a package manager helps you find and install packages. If you need a package that requires a different version of Python, you do not need to switch to a different environment manager, because conda is also an environment manager. With just a few commands, you can set up a totally separate environment to run that different version of Python, while continuing to run your usual version of Python in your normal environment.

# Python Frameworks

Frameworks automate the common implementation of common solutions which gives the flexibility to the users to focus on the application logic instead of the basic routine processes.

Frameworks make the life of web developers easier by giving them a structure for app development. They provide common patterns in a web application that are fast, reliable and easily maintainable.
