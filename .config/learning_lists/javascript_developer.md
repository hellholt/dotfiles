# JavaScript

JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It lets us add interactivity to pages e.g. you might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, etc on different websites -- all of that is built using JavaScript. Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.

# History of JavaScript

JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995. It has a bizarre history of naming; initially, it was named Mocha by the creator, which was later renamed LiveScript. In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to JavaScript with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community (although JavaScript did not have any relationship with Java) and released Netscape 2.0 with the official support of JavaScript.

# Javascript Versions

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich, and in 1997 and became an ECMA standard. ECMAScript is the official language name. ECMAScript versions include ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6

- [Brief History of JavaScript](https://roadmap.sh/guides/history-of-javascript)

# How to run Javascript

JavaScript can be run in the browser by including the external script file using the `script` tag, writing it within the HTML page using the `script` tag again, running it in the browser console or you can also use [REPL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-node-js-repl).

- [How To Use the JavaScript Developer Console](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-developer-console)

# Javascript Variables

Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. To store and represent this information in the JavaScript codebase, we use variables. A variable is a container for a value.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [JavaScript Variables](https://javascript.info/variables)
- [Storing the information you need — Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables)

# Hoisting

JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [What is Hoisting - MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)
- [JavaScript Hoisting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-hoisting/)

# Naming Rules

A variable name should accurately identify your variable. When you create good variable names, your JavaScript code becomes easier to understand and easier to work with. Properly naming variables is really important. JavaScript also has some rules when it comes to naming variables; read about these rules through the links below.

# Datatypes

Data type refers to the type of data that a JavaScript variable can hold. There are seven primitive data types in JavaScript (Number, BigInt, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined and Symbol). Objects are non-primitives.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [JavaScript Data Types - CodeGuage](https://www.codeguage.com/courses/js/data-types)
- [JavaScript data types and data structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)
- [JavaScript Data Types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)
- [JavaScript Data Types](https://javascript.info/types)

# Primitive Types

In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types:

- `string`
- `number`
- `bigint`
- `boolean`
- `undefined`
- `Symbol`
- `null`

Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Primitive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive)

# TypeOf Operator

You can use the typeOf operator to find the data type of a JavaScript variable.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Typeof Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)
- [Typeof Live Examples](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_typeof_all)

# Type Casting

Type conversion (or typecasting) means the transfer of data from one data type to another. Implicit conversion happens when the compiler (for compiled languages) or runtime (for script languages like [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript)) automatically converts data types. The source code can also explicitly require a conversion to take place.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Type Conversions](https://javascript.info/type-conversions)
- [JavaScript Type Conversion](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_type_conversion.asp)
- [Type Casting in JavaScript](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/type-casting-in-javascript)
- [JavaScript Type Cast](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-type-conversion)

# Type Conversion/Coercion

Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers). Type conversion is similar to type coercion because they convert values from one data type to another with one key difference — type coercion is implicit. In contrast, type conversion can be either implicit or explicit.

- [Type Conversion - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Type_Conversion)
- [Type Coercion - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Type_coercion)
- [Type Conversion and Coercion video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfQyMPzPTjY)

# Explicit Type Casting

Type casting means transferring data from one data type to another by explicitly specifying the type to convert the given data to. Explicit type casting is normally done to make data compatible with other variables. Examples of typecasting methods are `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()`, `toString()`.

- [Type conversion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Type_Conversion)
- [What is typecasting in JavaScript](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/explain-typecasting-in-javascript)

# Implicit Type Casting

Implicit type conversion happens when the compiler or runtime automatically converts data types. JavaScript is loosely typed language and most of the time operators automatically convert a value to the right type.

# Data Structures

A Data structure is a format to organize, manage and store data in a way that allows efficient access and modification. JavaScript has primitive (built-in) and non-primitive (not built-in) data structures. Primitive data structures come by default with the programming language and you can implement them out of the box (like arrays and objects). Non-primitive data structures don't come by default and you have to code them up if you want to use them.

# Equality Comparisons

Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values. Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [JavaScript Comparisons](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp)
- [JavaScript Equality Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#equality_operators)

# Value Comparison Operators

In javascript, the `==` operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the `===` operator compares the values and the data types of the operands. The `Object.is()` method determines whether two values are the same value: `Object.is(value1, value2)`.

`Object.is()` is not equivalent to the `==` operator. The `==` operator applies various coercions to both sides (if they are not the same type) before testing for equality (resulting in such behavior as `"" == false` being `true`), but `Object.is()` doesn't coerce either value.

`Object.is()` is also not equivalent to the `===` operator. The only difference between `Object.is()` and `===` is in their treatment of signed zeros and `NaN` values. The `===` operator (and the `==` operator) treats the number values `-0` and `+0` as equal but treats `NaN` as not equal to each other.

# Loops and Iterations

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

```
for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}
```

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Loops and iteration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)

# for...in statement

The for...in statement iterates over all enumerable properties of an object that are keyed by strings (ignoring ones keyed by Symbols), including inherited enumerable properties.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [for...in statement - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)
- [The for..in loop with examples](https://javascript.info/object#forin)

# for...of statement

The for...of statement executes a loop that operates on a sequence of values sourced from an iterable object. Iterable objects include instances of built-ins such as Array, String, TypedArray, Map, Set, NodeList (and other DOM collections), and the arguments object, generators produced by generator functions, and user-defined iterables.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [for...of statement - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)

# The `for` loop

The `for` loop is a standard control-flow construct in many programming languages, including JavaScript. It's commonly used to iterate over given sequences or iterate a known number of times and execute a piece of code for each iteration.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [JavaScript for Loop - CodeGuage](https://www.codeguage.com/courses/js/loops-for-loop)
- [The for Loop - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)

# do...while statement

The `do...while` statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to `false`. The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [do...while - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while)
- [JavaScript do...while Loop - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_dowhile.asp)

# while statement

The `while` statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to `true`. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [While Statement - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)
- [The while Loop - CodeGuage](https://www.codeguage.com/courses/js/loops-while-loop)

# Control Flow

In JavaScript, the `Control flow` is a way of how your computer runs code from top to bottom. It starts from the first line and ends at the last line unless it hits any statement that changes the control flow of the program such as loops, conditionals, etc.

We can control the flow of the program through any of these control structures:

- Sequential (default mode)
- Conditional Statements
- Exception Handling
- Loops and Iterations
  
Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Control Flow - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow)

# Expressions and Operators

At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate. The expression `x = 7` is an example of the first type. This expression uses the `=` operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7. The expression `3 + 4` is an example of the second type. This expression uses the `+` operator to add `3` and `4` together and produces a value, `7`. However, if it's not eventually part of a bigger construct (for example, a variable declaration like const `z = 3 + 4`), its result will be immediately discarded `—` this is usually a programmer mistake because the evaluation doesn't produce any effects. As the examples above also illustrate, all complex expressions are joined by operators, such as `=` and `+`.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Expressions and operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

# Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (`=`), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, `x = f()` is an assignment expression that assigns the value of `f()` to `x`.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Assignment Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators)
- [Basic Operators](https://javascript.info/operators#assignment)

# Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are the operators that compare values and return true or false. The operators include: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `===`, `!=` and `!==`

- [Comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators)

# Arithmetic operators

The Arithmetic operators perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and remainder operations.

Arithmetic operators in JavaScript are as follows:

- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `**` (Exponentiation)
- `/` (Division)
- `%` (Modulus i.e. Remainder)
- `++` (Increment)
- `--` (Decrement)

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Arithmetic Operators - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#arithmetic_operators)
- [Arithmetic Operators - JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/operators#maths)
- [JavaScript Arithmetic Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)

# Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bits (zeros & ones) and work on the level of their binary representation.
Ex. Decimal number `9` has a binary representation of `1001`. Bitwise operators perform their operations on such binary representations, but they return standard JavaScript numerical values.

Bitwise operators in JavaScript are as follows:

- `&` (AND)
- `|` (OR)
- `^` (XOR)
- `~` (NOT)
- `<<` (Left SHIFT)
- `>>` (Right SHIFT)
- `>>>` (Zero-Fill Right SHIFT)

- [Bitwise Operators - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#bitwise_operators)
- [Bitwise Operators - JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/operators#bitwise-operators)

# Logical Operators

There are four logical operators in JavaScript: `||` (OR), `&&` (AND), `!` (NOT), `??` (Nullish Coalescing).

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Logical Operators - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#binary_logical_operators)
- [Logical Operators - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#binary_logical_operators)

# BigInt Operators

Most operators that can be used with the `Number` data type will also work with `BigInt` values (e.g. arithmetic, comparison, etc.). However, the unsigned right shift `>>>` operator is an exception and is not supported. Similarly, some operators may have slight differences in behaviour (for example, division with `BigInt` will round towards zero).

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [BigInt Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#bigint_operators)

# String Operators

In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (`+`) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.

The shorthand assignment operator `+=` can also be used to concatenate strings.

- [String Concatenation - JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/operators#string-concatenation-with-binary)

# Conditional operators

Conditional operator also known as Ternary operator is the only JS operator that takes three operands.

The operator can have one of two values based on a condition.

Syntax:

`condition ? val_for_true : val_for_false`

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [W3Schools - JavaScript Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp)

# Comma operators

The comma operator (`,`) evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand. This lets you create a compound expression in which multiple expressions are evaluated, with the compound expression's final value being the value of the rightmost of its member expressions. This is commonly used to provide multiple parameters to a `for` loop.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Comma operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_Operator)

# Unary Operators

JavaScript Unary Operators are the special operators that consider a single operand and perform all the types of operations on that single operand. These operators include unary plus, unary minus, prefix increments, postfix increments, prefix decrements, and postfix decrements.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Unary Operators in JavaScript](https://www.educba.com/unary-operators-in-javascript/)
- [Unary Operators - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#unary_operators)

# Relational Operators

Relational operators are also known as comparison operators. They are used to find the relationship between two values or compare the relationship between them; on the comparison, they yield the result true or false.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Relational Operators - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#relational_operators)

# Functions

Functions exist so we can reuse code. They are blocks of code that execute whenever they are invoked. Each function is typically written to perform a particular task, like an addition function used to find the sum of two or more numbers. When numbers need to be added anywhere within your code, the addition function can be invoked as many times as necessary.

- [JavaScript Functions in Detail - CodeGuage](https://www.codeguage.com/courses/js/functions-basics)

# Defining and Calling Functions

**Defining:**

- JavaScript function *declarations* are made by using the `function` keyword.
- Functions can also be defined by saving function *expressions* to a variable. "Arrow" functions are commonly used in this way.

**Calling:**

- When a function is defined, it is not yet executed.
- To call and invoke a function's code, use the function's name followed by parentheses: `functionName()`.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Defining Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#defining_functions)
- [Calling Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#calling_functions)
- [Function Definitions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_definition.asp)

# Arrow Functions

Arrow Function is a new way of creating functions with the '=>' operator with a shorter syntax.

- [MDN - Arrow Function Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
- [JavaScript Arrow Function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp)

# IIFE

Immediately-Invoked Function Expression is a function that is executed immediately after it is created.

- [JavaScript in Plain English - IIFE](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/https-medium-com-javascript-in-plain-english-stop-feeling-iffy-about-using-an-iife-7b0292aba174)

# Arguments object

The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function, available within all non-arrow functions. You can refer to a function's arguments inside that function by using its arguments object. It has entries for each argument the function was called with, with the first entry's index at 0. But, in modern code, rest parameters should be preferred.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [The arguments object - MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)

# Built in functions

- A JavaScript **method** is a property containing a **function definition** . In other words, when the data stored on an object is a function we call that a method.
- To differentiate between properties and methods, we can think of it this way: **A property is what an object has, while a method is what an object does.**
- Since JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects, we first need to have objects to start with. There are several objects built into JavaScript which we can use.

- [Built-in Functions:](https://www.tutorialride.com/javascript/javascript-built-in-functions.htm)

# This Keyword

In JavaScript, the `this` keyword is a little different compared to other languages. It refers to an object, but it depends on how or where it is being invoked. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.

- In an object method, `this` refers to the object
- Alone, `this` refers to the global object
- In a function, `this` refers to the global object
- In a function, in strict mode, `this` is undefined
- In an event, `this` refers to the element that received the event
- Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer `this` to any object

- [This Keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

# Function Borrowing

Function borrowing allows us to use the methods of one object on a different object without having to make a copy of that method and maintain it in two separate places. It is accomplished through the use of `.call()`, `.apply()`, or `.bind()`, all of which exist to explicitly set this on the method we are borrowing.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Function borrowing](https://medium.com/@ensallee/function-borrowing-in-javascript-4bd671e9d7b4)

# this in a method

Methods are properties of an object which are functions. The value of this inside a method is equal to the calling object. In simple words, this value is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.

- [`this` in methods](https://javascript.info/object-methods#this-in-methods)
- [Short and clear post about the `this` keyword](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp)

# this in a function

The keyword `this` when used in a function refers to the global object.

*Note: in a browser window the global object is the `window` object.*

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [this in a function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp)

# Using this alone

The keyword `this` when used alone refers to the global object.

*Note: in a browser window the global object is the `window` object.*

# Explicit binding

Explicit binding is when you use the `call` or `apply` methods to explicitly set the value of `this` in a function. Explicit Binding can be applied using `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`.

# call() method

The `call()` method calls the function with a reference to the aspire object to `this` keyword. `call()` method accepts an argument list and each arguments should be provided individually.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [call() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call)

# apply() method

`apply()` method is almost identical to `call()` method, except that `call()` method accepts an argument list, while `apply()` method accepts a single array of arguments.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [apply() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply)

# bind() method

The `bind()` method return a new method that has its `this` keyword refers to the aspire object, with a given sequence of arguments which can be call later.

# Asynchronous JavaScript

Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

Many functions provided by browsers, especially the most interesting ones, can potentially take a long time, and therefore, are asynchronous. For example:

- Making HTTP requests using `fetch()`
- Accessing a user's camera or microphone using `getUserMedia()`
- Asking a user to select files using `showOpenFilePicker()`

So even though you may not have to implement your own asynchronous functions very often, you are very likely to need to use them correctly.

# Event Loop

The Event Loop is one of the most important aspects to understand about Node.js. Why is this so important? Because it explains how Node.js can be asynchronous and have non-blocking I/O, it explains the "killer feature" of Node.js, which made it this successful.

# setTimeout

The setTimeout runs a function after the specified period expires. Times are declared in milliseconds.

- [setTimeout EXPLAINED in 5 minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9lJb4D3nJY)

# setInterval

The `setInterval()` method helps us to repeatedly execute a function after a fixed delay. It returns a unique interval ID which can later be used by the `clearInterval()` method, which stops further repeated execution of the function.

`setInterval()` is similar to setTimeout, with a difference. Instead of running the callback function once, it will run it forever, at the specific time interval you specify (in milliseconds):

# Modules

Modules encapsulate all sorts of code like functions and variables and expose all this to other files. Generally, we use it to break our code into separate files to make it more maintainable. They were introduced into JavaScript with ECMAScript 6.

- [Dynamic imports](https://javascript.info/modules-dynamic-imports)

# CommonJS

CommonJS modules are the original way to package JavaScript code for Node.js. Node.js also supports the ESModules standard used by browsers and other JavaScript runtimes, but CJS is still widely used in backend Node.js applications. Sometimes these modules will be written with a .cjs extension.

- [How to Import and Export Modules in CJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTND4rjATXA)

# ESModules

ESModules is a standard that was introduced with ES6 (2015). The idea was to standardize how JS modules work and implement these features in browsers. This standard is widely used with frontend frameworks such as react and can also be used in the backend with Node.js. Sometimes these modules will be written with a .mjs extension.

# Memory Management

Low-level languages like C, have manual memory management primitives such as malloc() and free(). In contrast, JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects are created and frees it when they are not used anymore (garbage collection). This automaticity is a potential source of confusion: it can give developers the false impression that they don't need to worry about memory management.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [JavaScript Garbage Collection](https://javascript.info/garbage-collection)
- [Memory Management in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management)

# Memory lifecycle

Regardless of the programming language, the memory life cycle is pretty much always the same:

- Allocate the memory you need
- Use the allocated memory (read, write)
- Release the allocated memory when it is not needed anymore

The second part is explicit in all languages. The first and last parts are explicit in low-level languages but are mostly implicit in high-level languages like JavaScript.

- [Lifecycle in Memory Management](https://medium.com/swlh/the-lifecycle-of-memory-in-javascript-5b5bffc5ff4c)

# Garbage Collection

Memory management in JavaScript is performed automatically and invisibly to us. We create primitives, objects, functions… All that takes memory. The main concept of memory management in JavaScript is reachability.

# Javascript chrome dev tools

These are a set of tools built into the browser to aid frontend developers diagnose and solve various issues in their applications — such as JavaScript and logical bugs, CSS styling issues or even just making quick temporary alterations to the DOM.

To enter the dev tools, right click and click **Inspect** (or press `ctrl+shift+c`/`cmd+opt+c`) to enter the Elements panel. Here you can debug CSS and HTML issues. If you want to see logged messages or interact with javascript, enter the **Console** tab from the tabs above (or press `ctrl+shift+j` or `F12` /`cmd+opt+j` to enter it directly). Another very useful feature in the Chrome dev tools is the Lighthouse (for checking performance).

NOTE: This isn't a chrome-specific feature, and most browsers (Chromium based or otherwise) will have their own, largely-similar set of devtools.

- [Mastering Chrome Dev Tools](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/mastering-chrome-developer-tools-next-level-front-end-development-techniques-3ac0b6fe8a3/)

# Debugging issues

When you're just starting out with JavaScript development, you might use a lot of `console.log()` statement in your code to log and check values of variables while debugging. The results of these would show up in the **Console** panel, along with a reference to the line and file of code which originated it.

However, for quicker, more complex and easier to handler debugging (which also doesn't litter your codebase with `console.log()`s), breakpoints and the sources panel is your friend.

# Debugging Memory Leaks

In JavaScript, memory leaks commonly occur within heap allocated memory, where short lived objects are attached to long lived ones and the Garbage Collector cannot safely de-allocate that memory as it is still referenced from the root set (the global object).

# Debugging performance

Enter the dev tools and check out the Lighthouse tab. This is essentially a series of tests which analyses the currently open website on a bunch of metrics related to performance, page speed, accessibility, etc. Feel free to run the tests by clicking the **Analyse Page Load** button (you might want to do this in an incognito tab to avoid errors arising from extensions you're using). Once you have the results, take your time and read through them (and do click through to the reference pages mentioned alongside each test result to know more about it!)

# Working with APIs

When working with remote APIs, you need a way to interact with those APIs. Modern JavaScript provides two native ways to send HTTP requests to remote servers, `XMLHttpRequest` and `Fetch`.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [Fetching data from the server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Fetching_data)
- [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
- [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

- [Ajax Battle: XMLHttpRequest vs the Fetch API](https://blog.openreplay.com/ajax-battle-xmlhttprequest-vs-the-fetch-api)

# XMLHttpRequest

`XMLHttpRequest` (XHR) is a built-in browser object that can be used to interact with server. XHR allows you to update data without having to reload a web page. Despite the word XML in its name, XHR not only used to retrieve data with XML format, we can use it with any type of data, like JSON, file(s), and much more.

- [Network request - XMLHttpRequest](https://javascript.info/xmlhttprequest)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_http.asp)

# Fetch

The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request to the server and load the information on the webpages. The request can be of any APIs that return the data of the format JSON or XML. This method returns a promise.
